This year the school education sector in Punjab certainly saw some ups even as the last quarter of 2018 was marked by two-month-long protests by Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and RMSA teachers from October.

As the contractual teachers protested against the state government's decision to regularise 8,886 teachers, but with pay cut, as many as 2,265 government schools saw a facelift with world-class infrastructure. Also the students of several government schools set unprecedented examples of their IQ level. And last, but not the least, English, the subject, in which maximum number of students fail in the final exams of Punjab School Education Board, is no more dreaded in many government schools now.

The schools were given a facelift under 'Smart School Project' launched by the government. Crores have been spent on attractive clean buildings, smart classrooms, computer rooms, hygienic toilets, playgrounds, drinking water facilities and colourful premises. Government, however, has not spent from its pocket, but motivated individual donors, Non-government Organisations (NGOs), charitable trusts, firms, and Non-resident Indians to financially help the schools.

Even Director General School Education-cum-Project Director Parshant Goyal had written to several NGOs, charitable trusts and firms to contribute towards digital classrooms, laboratories and toilets, provide books in libraries, uniforms to the students, create infrastructure for Midday Meals and sports, install solar power plants and Reverse Osmosis system and any way that the donor or the school deemed fit.

Education Secretary Krishan Kumar confirmed the infrastructure in 2,265 schools have already been improved and by the end of this academic session, a total of 4,250 institutes will be covered. He said some 100 teachers of Punjab are supporting them hugely by motivating people.

""With the contribution of such people and organisations, it will become a sustainable model of community ownership and accountability,"" said he, adding the government will provide support on pedagogy, ways of teaching, resolving specific problems etc. ""It will enhance the performance of the government schools in every possible manner. We will cover all 20,000 government schools in a few years,"" said he.

Several government schools, including government middle schools at Rajgarh village (Ludhiana), Malwa and Nawanshahr, have already started getting applications from people in advance for reservation of seats for their wards for the next session, revealed the education secretary. ""Two government school teachers in Nawanshahr have got admitted their wards,"" said he.

""It is a dream come true for us as we belong to poor families and haven't even thought of having access to facilities like e-content, computer labs and libraries,"" said one Kamljit Kaur of Kishangarh village in Mansa district. Along with the infrastructure, the education standard has also started improving. The students of Government Primary School, Jhangerian, in Nurpur Bedi block of Ropar district, have set an example. Several students of this schools have memorised the names of all 117 Assembly segments, 13 Lok Sabha constituencies, names of several countries with their respective capitals, that of Punjabi and Indian English writers, Indian scientists, Indian festivals, national holidays and neighbouring countries. The Class I children of this school have memorised tables up to 20, while as per syllabus, they need to learn just up to 5.

Education secretary has also uploaded the videos of these children on social media. ""Under Parho Paunjab Project, we have designed several programmes and now our students are speaking in English without any hesitation and several schools have started conducting prayers in English now,"" said District Mentor of English, Chander Shekhar.

Even, a renowned missionary-run convent school, St Francis in Batala (Gurdaspur district) had invited the government school students during a Science and maths fair recently. ""The government school students explained maths and science equations in fluent English to their convent counterparts,"" said Principal of St Francis School, P J Joseph."

In 2019, my personal journey will continue: I am training harder -- and smarter -- than ever, looking forward to more titles and medals as we approach the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. But there are larger uncertainties and questions: What can we do to encourage more women across all spheres, especially in sports? How can India give its best-ever performance at the Olympics? What is it that young girls and women across the nation can learn from my struggles and successes?

Let's first talk about India's prospects at international sports meets in general, with an eye on Tokyo in particular. The first thing sports, particularly those which centre around individual achievement, (and not just the one team game that draws so much attention and resources) needs is more funding. Funds are the first step towards building the infrastructure and expertise that can recognise, nurture and maintain the excellence that is required to perform at the highest level. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), for instance, mandates that schools have a certain infrastructure, that every child in India has access to specific facilities close to their home, in their own locality.

We can look at China and the difference that sports facilities have made to their performance at the international level. What is needed is an SSA-like scheme for sports. All children enjoy playing, and it is this joy that turns into grit and determination. With every child guaranteed the right facilities, they can learn to play and be recognised if they have an aptitude for a particular game at an early age. I remember in my own school days, I began with teaspoon-races and three-legged races! Every game counts. Today, my own children are always playing, they love it and along with their studies, it forms an important part of their overall development.

It is also important for there to be complete coordination between the government and sports federations and unity even within the sports federations themselves. The government, of course, is already doing a lot for sports and its growth. Under the Target Olympic Podium (TOP) scheme, which was instituted by the current NDA government in September 2014, the government is investing considerable funds in promoting talent. To provide an impetus towards an athlete's training, facilities, coaching et al is provided, along with a stipend of Rs 50,000. This is not a small amount. I never earned that much even when I had a government job!

In the new year, we must ask for efficiency and accountability not only from the government and sports authorities, but also from the athletes themselves. In a country like India, with limited resources, is it fair that even under-performing persons continue to get such a handsome allowance and facilities?

The stipends and facilities must be performance-linked in sports, as in any other field. This will have multiple positive effects. First, it will ensure that new talent among the younger generation also gets a fair chance and fresh blood is injected into the athlete pool in the country. Second, it will keep those who are receiving the facilities on their toes and not let any kind of lethargy or a lackadaisical attitude to set in. Third, even for those who lose their benefits, it will act as a motivating force for them to perform better.

Another aspect of sports in India that requires attention is the increasingly stellar performance of women. Women are now outperforming men in international events. Clearly, this is an area that the government, as well as all other interested parties, should focus on. Developing the potential of India's girls and women will only lead to more international recognition, which in turn will fuel the growth of sports at home, creating a much-needed virtuous cycle.

In our society, women are often discouraged from performing multiple roles. But to the girls and women of India, I say that you should chase excellence and achievement. Age, marital status, region, religion -- none of this should stand in your way. After being married and having children, I continued to train -- and win -- at the highest level. This required a great effort on my part, I have learnt to listen to my body and mind and find people who when they work with me, understand my way of working. Whatever you do in life, these lessons are important. It is important to step out of the home and follow your dreams and passions. Achievement can only come through hard work. We all have to give ourselves the opportunity to do that work, only then can we scale new heights.

I come from a relatively small community, one which is not particularly wealthy or powerful even in my home state. Yet, today, because of my achievements, I am a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha. I am truly grateful for this opportunity. I can turn to the most powerful and popular people, and tell them with pride that my achievements, my Olympic medal, world championships and all the other titles, are because of hard work and dedication.

In the next year, there will be a general election, which is important for the entire country. My only wish is that it be a fair election, a free one where the will of the people is clearly expressed. After the people elect a government, it must work for the development of the entire nation, as I am sure it will endeavour to do.

I hope that in 2019, I continue to do India proud on the global stage and there are others who are inspired to do the same in all walks of life."

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

India as a country, in terms of expanse and population, is huge. With a population of over 1.2 billion, 39% are children, which is around 470 million. Children are not just our future, but our present too, and we need to work collectively to ensure that their rights are protected.

Was 2018 a game-changer for India's children? While some decisions taken by the Centre have been a step towards the right direction, events in which child rights have been violated have slowed down the growth process. Certain cases like Kathua, Unnao and the Bihar shelter homes incident depict the grim severity of the situation, and the urgency for us to step up as citizens to take a definitive action against these incidents.

Shelter Homes and The Trafficking of Persons Bill

One of the monumental decisions taken by the Parliament was the passing of The Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill 2018 by the Lok Sabha in the July session. It proposes a punishment ranging from 10 years of rigorous imprisonment to life term and a fine of not less than Rs 1 lakh for people caught in carrying out trafficking activities. It aims to create institutional mechanisms at the district, state and central level to curb trafficking.Hundreds of children go missing in India every year and are sold for labour or sexual exploitation. The bill has provisions to provide rehabilitation, skill development and education to the victims.

As the Parliament winter session is ongoing, over 12,000 trafficking survivors from 14 states have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the passage of the Trafficking bill in the Rajya Sabha. Women and Child development minister Maneka Gandhi also expressed hope for the passage of the crucial trafficking bill.

The Deoria shelter home incident was another case that gained limelight. A shelter home in Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, run by Girija Tripathi was found to be engaging in illegal activities. The girls in the shelter home were subjected to physical, sexual and mental abuse. Tripathi used her clout with influential local politicians and bureaucrats to run the home and get away with these barbaric acts. 24 girls aged 5-15 were rescued from being trafficked, but 18 are still missing.

The Kathua Rape Case Shook the Nation

The year started on a shocking note. In January 2018, 8-year-old Asifa Bano was abducted, drugged with sedatives, brutally raped and murdered in Kathua, Jammu & Kashmir. A week after she went missing, her body was found by villagers of the neighbouring village.

The Kathua rape case was just one of the many. After the incident, the Parliament took a stand and passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2018. The amendment calls for death punishment for rapists who have raped girls below the age of 12. If the girl is under 16, the minimum punishment will be 20 years to life imprisonment; a change from the previous 10 year sentence. In case of gangrape of a girl below 12 years of age, the accused will be sentenced to life imprisonment or death. The bill also mandates that the investigation and trial must be completed within two months and dismissed.

Children and Health

United Nations Child Mortality Report released this year stated that there were 1.14 million children deaths in India every year. This means 3 infants die every minute. Most of the children die before they turn 5 due to curable and preventable diseases like pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and birth complications.The number of deaths was the lowest India has had in 5 years but is still the highest in the world.

This September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Ayushman Bharat Scheme. This scheme is supposedly the world's largest health care scheme. It will provide 10 crore poor households a reimbursement of upto Rs.5 lakh for secondary and tertiary hospitalisation charges of the entire family. This year 17 crore children were given polio drops catering to a healthy childhood.

Children in Schools

Twelve million children are yet to be enrolled in schools.The dropout rate is fairly high either due to affordability or some other social issue. Girls are married off at a young age and forced to quit schools. 1 in every 3 child brides in the world is a girl in India. The National Social Assistance programme has allocated Rs. 9975 crore by the government this year. The budget plans to treat education holistically.

The emphasis is on improving education by giving proper training to teachers. A merger of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan is in the pipeline. This joint scheme envisions to ensure inclusive and equitable education from nursery to the senior secondary stage.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that the country is looking to spend Rs 1 trillion to revitalize the infrastructure of higher educational institutions.

The Gender Divide

According to the Lancet Global Health Journal released in May 2018, around 2,39,000 girls under the age of 5 die each year in India due to gender discrimination.

Once the girl is born, negligence in her upbringing leads to illnesses. 32% of the girls enrolled in schools drop out. This is because of family constraints, insufficient funds and lack of sanitation facilities during their menstruation cycle. Therefore, the percentage of literate women and girls is less in comparison to men.

The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme started by the Government in 2015 aims to improve the efficiency of implementation of welfare schemes for women. Through the government campaigns people have started realizing that gender doesn't define capability. This programme has increased the intake of girls in schools but it still has a long way to go.

2018 has seen a number of child rights violation cases, but also seen steps to resolve them and prevent such events in future. We, as responsible citizens, need to question and observe the life children are leading and do our bit to save their childhood. A small step towards the right direction can go a long way in making India safe for children."

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

As a step towards 'merger', all chief educational officers have been instructed to send the list of such elementary and high schools located within or near higher secondary schools. ""The department is collecting the data now so that action can be initiated next academic year. After merging, the school buildings will be converted into libraries or adult learning centres,"" said an officer, requesting anonymity.

Friday was set as the deadline to submit the list, according to a letter sent to all officers on December 17, days after they met in Chennai.

Tamil Nadu had earlier informed the Centre that it had taken an initiative to merge 1,053 government schools. Also, funds for another 1,950 schools with less than 15 students each were stopped recently.

This move was adopted so that Tamil Nadu adhered to Samagara Shisksha Abhiyan's (SSA) guidelines. SSA was formed recently by merging erstwhile schemes -- Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Class I-VIII) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (Class IX-XII).

Under the new guidelines, government schools with less than 15 students are not eligible to receive the composite school grant, ranging from ?25,000 to ?1,00,000 depending on student strength.

Composite grants were used by schools to improve infrastructure, maintain toilets, buy material to develop students' reading skills and carry out other development activities.

Of the 31,200 government schools, nearly 3,000 institutions that come under various municipalities or are run by departments such as Adi Dravidar, Kallar Reclamation, forest and social welfare have a strength of less than 25 students, shows official data.

So, only ?89.6 crore was released as composite grants for schools in TN this year despite ?97.18 crore being earmarked. Condemning this, educationist Prince Gajendra Babu said the governments were systematically destroying state-funded schools by denying funds and it was unfair to expect parents to admit their children in these schools without adequate teaching staff or facilities."

In a push to provide international quality education in the Marathi language, the Maharashtra International Education Board was established on Tuesday (25 December), with an affiliation of 13 schools, reports The Indian Express.

Launched on former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's birth anniversary, each school coming under the board will be called 'Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee International School'.

The 13 initial schools affiliated with the board are spread across the districts of Buldhana, Washim, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Thane, Sindhudurg, Chandrapur, Gondia, Nandurbar, Nashik, Kolhapur, Pune and Satara. The next step in the works is to expand the board to cover 100 schools next year.

Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar commended the initiative as something which is not imported from outside but can be exported internationally. He called the programme a continuation of Vajpayee's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.

The board's international curriculum will mean the students will be taught about the outside world, along with their own local subjects.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also lauded the move, stating,""With the formation of the board, we are entering into a new era. It is a true tribute to Vajpayee. The schools' names will remain the same but the education pattern shall be named after Vajpayee.""

The schools affiliated to the board will also have an emphasis on improving the English language skills of their pupils. Moreover, the new board's syllabus will include certain aspects of Sanskrit as well.

By Abha Goradia

To provide international standard education to students in Marathi, their native language, a first-of-its-kind Maharashtra International Education Board came into being on Tuesday. Launched to commemorate the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, all schools affiliated to the board will be known as Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee International School.

As the first step, 13 schools from 13 districts were given affiliation from the board. The affiliated schools are from Buldhana, Washim, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Thane, Sindhudurg, Chandrapur, Gondia, Nandurbar, Nashik, Kolhapur, Pune and Satara. By next year, the board plans to increase the number of schools to 100.

Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the initiative is an extension of Vajpayee's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and will focus on inclusive education. ""It is not an imported board but a board that can be exported,"" he said.

The international syllabus will include knowledge of surrounding areas and the world outside. Education in these schools will be provided in Marathi medium, though there will be an emphasis on improving English language.

Maintaining that the department is working towards ""operation digital board"", Javadekar said that in 15 lakh institutions, students would be taught in digital mode from Class IX to third-year in college in the next three years. The department also plans to introduce exams in Class V and VIII to promote continuous evaluation, he said.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said: ""With the formation of the board, we are entering into a new era. It is a true tribute to Vajpayee. The schools' names will remain the same but the education pattern shall be named after Vajpayee.""

Maharashtra has two crore students from classes I to XII, said School Education Minister Vinod Tawde. ""We need to nurture students to not just prepare for international courses but to also sustain and be successful,"" he added.

""Through the new system, students will learn not just for marks but also develop qualities and life-skills... We have evolved from a Gurukul system, and the new board has included aspects of Sanskrit in its course,"" said state Minister for Rural Development Pankaja Munde.

According to a government resolution dated October 14, 2016, 100 schools run by tribal development, social justice and school education departments would be affiliated to the new board. The criteria for providing affiliation included joint initiative by all stakeholders; number of students; infrastructure facilities, including a well-constructed building; facility to increase intake capacity; separate washrooms for girls and boys; Internet facilities; clean surroundings as well as facilities to use academic technology and ferrying students, among others.

With just three months left for the conclusion of the current academic year, Samagra Shiksha, Keralam, is gearing up to utilise the funds allocated for various projects for school students on time.

The Union government merged the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shikshak Abhiyan to form Samagra Shiksha early this year.

Improvement of academic standards as well as infrastructure development at schools from pre-primary to Class 12 were brought within its ambit. However, there had been a delay in convening a meeting of functionaries of the new entity, which also resulted in many projects getting stuck. As the non-utilisation of allocated funds this academic year may lead to the Centre reducing the funds next year, a State-level workshop is now being held in Kozhikode.

K.J. Harikumar, State Programme Officer, Samgra Shiksha, Keralam, told The Hindu on Sunday that it had been decided to conduct a 'Mikavulsavam' for students of Classes 1 to 7 in aided and government schools to improve academic standards. English teachers in higher secondary schools will be given special training. They would be given Malayalam translations of history, geography and economics textbooks, he added.

According to sources, coordinators of the programme from 14 districts and Block Resource Centre functionaries are participating in the workshop. It has been decided to complete the construction of science parks in all aided and government schools under the aegis of Samgra Shiksha, by the next academic year. The ongoing projects to improve the efficiency of students in science, mathematics, and English, Malayalam and Hindi will be modified and rearranged, if necessary."

This programme subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the 'school' as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels. The States/UTs are assisted by the central government to implement the Samagra Shiksha as a programme for providing universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education.

The major interventions under the scheme are: (i) Universal Access including Infrastructure Development and Retention; (ii) Gender and Equity; (iii) Inclusive Education; (iv) Quality; (v) Financial support for Teacher Salary; (vi) Digital initiatives; (vii) Entitlements under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 including uniforms, textbooks etc.;(viii) Pre-school Education; (ix) Vocational Education; (x) Sports and Physical Education; and (xi) Strengthening of Teacher Education and Training. The main emphasis of the Scheme is on improving quality of school education and the strategy of all interventions would be to enhance the Learning Outcomes at all levels of schooling.

The major features of Samagra Shiksha are as under:-

Preference for opening of new school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. The districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs) for ensuring equity and inclusion at all levels of school education. Provisions have also been made for 1020 residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

The RTE Act also provides for Special Training for age-appropriate admission of out-of-school children including children of disadvantaged groups in urban and rural areas. Approval has been given for special training of 8.08 lakh children with the financial outlay of Rs. 56353.95 lakh in 2018-19.

During 2018-19 an amount of Rs. 19668.26 crore has been released (as on 30.11.2018) to States/UTs as central share against the total Budget of Rs. 30891.81 crore for implementation of various interventions under Samagra Shiksha."

Over the last 30 years, India has done a remarkable job ensuring its citizens have access to education. Beginning with State-level policies such as the Andhra Pradesh Primary Education Programme and Shiksha Karmi in Rajasthan in 1984 and 1987, respectively, and culminating in the Centre's Right to Education Act in 2009, the legislative and programmatic attention to education has been tremendous. And with that, there has been a genuine expansion in access and provision at the primary level.

In the chart, historical data from the District Information System on Education (DISE) on the year a school was built have been used to show how the number of government schools across the country has increased relative to three major Central Government education policies, the National Policy on Education in 1986, the District Primary Education Programme in 1994, and the aforementioned Right to Education Act.

Given that it has now been approximately 16 years since the passage of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the first central level effort, what has this flurry of activity brought? Encouragingly, there have been real wins over time. India has nearly universalised access to education and is now educating more people, including girls, for longer than it ever has before. The programmes have built schools, gotten children into schools, and had them stay in school for longer.

Additionally, it seems like this is also increasing employment and wages. A paper by Gaurav Khanna at the University of California, San Diego, finds that an additional year of schooling has high returns in the labour market, and that large-scale policies to expand education, such as the District Primary Education Programme, redistribute income from high-skilled to low-skilled workers. These are real achievements to celebrate. But this is about where the cheer ends.

On the learning front, the picture is far less rosy. Year after year of results from the Annual State of Education Report (ASER), released by the NGO ASER, has shown that student learning at the primary level is low and not getting better. In 2017, ASER shifted its focus from children at the primary level to ask what is happening with older children in the ages 14-18. Here, the news was no better. Math and reading ability for students in this age group were poor and well below what the government's own standards suggested they should be.

While the government's own National Achievement Survey is more encouraging, it is not by much. India's performance in the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (more commonly known as PISA) tests was so controversial that India did not re-enter PISA again (although India has decided to re-enter for 2021). This story of low learning levels is well known to many.

What should we make of these two contradictory findings? On the one hand, access to education has increased, and this is showing real returns on the labour market, and redistribution skills towards low-skilled workers. On the other hand, learning is low for young and older children; it is not improving, and is poor even in comparison to other countries. A new concern is beginning to emerge with the growing demographic bulge of large numbers of young adults exiting the school system and entering the workforce. The promises of the education system are failing on more than just quality, and this could have dire consequences for those promised the world.

A new genre of non-fiction has emerged over the last couple of years tracing the gap between the aspirations and realities for India's youth. Journalists Somini Sengupta and Snigdha Poonam have both written books profiling this new young aspirational class, and many of their dashed aspirations. In both, we find a number of young Indians struggling to find their place in the world. Promised much by their educational attainment, they find their hopes dashed when they emerge into the adult world, with jobs that either fall short of expectations, or a lack of formal employment altogether.

My own work suggests a similar concern -- those that have gone to school for longer are less likely to be trusting of a wide number of public institutions in India.

Using the Indian Human Development Survey, I find that those children that gained access to education as a result of the DPEP then live in households that are less trusting of public institutions. More concerning, those ""DPEP children"" are adults today with their political preferences and economic aspirations.

Why is this happening? The data suggest that while these individuals are earning more money, they are also doing this in different parts of the labour market: the unorganised and short-term contractual labour. Again, the gap between aspirations and reality has led to resentment.

Latin America has seen the rise of a cohort of youth called ""Los NiNis,meaning ""They neither study or work.""

So what can India and other countries, do? There are two solutions: fix schools or fix the school-to-work transition. While fixing schools is clearly important and there is much to be done here, placing undue faith in schools as the sole panacea for this cohort will likely not solve the larger problem of a large number of youth who enter a labour market not as rewarding as promised and cause further distrust in the education system. Schools cannot be blamed for both their own failings and the failings of the outside world.

That leaves us with fixing the school-to-work transition. And here, most solutions lie with the state. Public sector employment -- the much desired sarkari naukri -- has not grown apace with the growth in India's population. According to Devesh Kapur, public sector employment has actually decreased over the last decade.

So an expansion of the public sector is clearly in order. While this will not absorb all of those looking for employment, it will help absorb some as well as address some of India's public management issues.

Next, some combination of general training, labour market matching, and support for employers in hiring young adults is required. Here, the results for middle- and low-income countries are encouraging.

It is clear that the question of how to integrate youth into a larger society is a universal one that spans more regions than just India. The solution, however, likely does not lie with education.

While there are many shortcomings of the education system in India and elsewhere, the question for society is about how to best integrate the young when they have left compulsory schooling but have yet to find work.

It is here that further progression through the education system will run headlong into frustrated expectations as a result of poor integration into labour markets and larger society. To paraphrase WEB DuBois, the problem of the 21st century is the problem of youth employment."

With the help of latest mobile technology, these excited children were trained to study their textbooks, helping them overcome their physical challenge in a way they did not think was possible before this. Each of them got a phone which had preloaded accessible textbooks, and they were taught to study these textbooks using latest mobile applications.

This innovation in CSR was made possible in one of its kind initiatives by mjunction services limited, India's largest B2B e-commerce company, in collaboration with the Chhattisgarh government. mjunction first procured the smartphones and then uploaded all Chhattisgarh government school textbooks for the intended age group into these smartphones. The third and last phase happened recently in Raipur when these 50 students were not only given these smartphones but also trained extensively on how to study their textbooks from these phones.

The programme gains greater importance in view of the limited availability of textbooks in Braille, where students had to share the books.

The reactions from the excited students were spontaneous and heartfelt, and sometimes exceeded expectations from the programme. Dinu Patel of class 8, said, ""What I could read on Braille in three days, I can now do in one day. I can also carry my books anywhere I go now as they are all on my mobile phone.""

Aarzoo Banu of class 9 said, ""My hands used to ache earlier while taking down class notes on Braille. Now with the recording facility on the phone, I can record my class notes and listen to them later with the 'talk back' facility.""

Yadeshwar Kumar Sahoo of class 9 said, ""This is especially useful when English spellings get complicated and it becomes difficult on Braille. I want to thank everyone associated with this as it really makes life easy for me.""

The students were handed certificates and felicitated at the end of the training programme at an event attended by top mjunction officials associated with the programme, Mr Gaurav Dwivedi, Secretary of School Education, Chhattisgarh Government and Mr Vinit Nandanwar, IAS, Mission Director, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Dr Homiyar Mobedji, Disability Expert, Program Management Benetech India, conducted the training process.

Welcoming the initiative, Mr Vinaya Varma, CEO of mjunction said, ""We are glad to collaborate with the Chhattisgarh government on this. This programme is a part of mjunction's social responsibility activities, and will be run as a pilot project. In the next phase, this will be extended to more students of Chhattisgarh government schools.""

Mr Dwivedi said, ""I am happy to partner with mjunction on this. The children were extremely enthusiastic about using new devices and trying new technology solutions to overcome their disability."" Mr Nandanwar said, ""The initiative was a success and I hope to work with mjunction once again in the near future for the benefit of an even greater number of students.""

Mr Nandanwar said ""The initiative of mjunction and Sarva Sikhsha team was really fruitful and we hope to work together in future and benefit more students.""

mjunction has been working in the field of digital literacy for the underprivileged for the last 11 years and has taken the pledge of 'Transforming 30K' lives in the next two years. With this project, it forays into the field of providing education via mobile literacy, and is just the beginning of more such initiatives which will touch lives positively, Mr Varma added."
