(Robert King/Newsmakers) Snapshot

Gene editing is likely to have unintended but adverse consequences. An ethical framework is the best guarantor against a worst-case scenario.

We tend to think about innovation in terms of technological prowess; but it turns out culture plays a crucial role. Similarly, we tend to think that technology per se is benign; but it turns out that ethical issues play an increasingly important role in the impact of technology on society. Technology is value-neutral, but its uses are anything but; innovators should, but don't, worry about the downsides as much as they hype the promised upside.

This issue has come into sharp focus with the announcement of the first allegedly genetically modified babies (GMBs). Chinese researcher He Jiankui announced in late November that he had used CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the foetal DNA of twin baby girls, Lulu and Nana. He said that he did this to make one twin immune to HIV, as their father is HIV+. He also claimed another woman is carrying a foetus that was also gene-edited in his lab. It's instructive to compare this to other ethical issues.

There have been many concerns expressed about algorithms that 'go rogue' and produce ethically deficient results. One classic case is the 'trolley problem' where a machine intelligence has to decide on a course of action that results in the death or injury of one set of individuals while saving another set of individuals. In the March 2017 issue of Swarajya, I reviewed Cathy O'Neill's Weapons of Math Destruction, about opaque big data algorithms deciding on things as diverse as sentences for crimes and teacher promotions based on criteria that may be unfair, racist, or inappropriate for the societal good.

Similarly, we have seen social media, which has its positives, being used to circulate fake news (leading to riots, murders, etc) or to allegedly affect election results (Cambridge Analytica and Facebook got into trouble for this). The era of 'deep fakes' is upon us: photos and videos doctored to appear authentic, so that for instance a famous leader may be seen saying things he never did say.

The Chinese Communist Party is using facial recognition and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a 'social credit' system, which is in effect a Big-Brother-like panopticon, watching everything an individual does: it may condemn you to gulags, as they are now doing to Uighurs.

But these ill-effects of technology pale in comparison to the can of worms that may be unleashed by tinkering with biology. There is a good reason why the entire world community has come together to ban biological weapons: the horrors that line of research can lead to are absolutely mind-blowing.

Among other things, biology is far more complex than we think, as argued by Robert Sapolsky in Behave: we are creatures not only of nature and nurture, but of even the dimly-understood effects of stress, experiences in childhood, trauma undergone by our Stone Age ancestors, and so forth. Besides, a few centuries of allopathy and Cartesian science have demonstrated that our understanding of cause and effect regarding the human body is less than perfect, much less.

A Pandora's Box may well open if we tinker with the human body (the precise gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 can be used both with adults and foetuses). The very first concern is that of natural selection and evolution. If a particular gene has made it through millennia of natural selection, it stands to reason that it has some value and confers some benefit. By snipping it out, are we causing unintended consequences elsewhere? For instance, the CRISPR removal of the gene CCR5 that allows HIV to infect human cells in Jiankui's gene-edited baby girl: what is its side-effect? Does its absence make you more likely to become obese? Or die early? Nobody knows.

Besides, there have been some studies that show that CRISPR is not as clean a 'surgical knife' as has been believed: it may cause anomalies in the rest of the individual's genetic code (CRISPR DNA editing may cause serious genetic damage, researchers warn, Techcrunch, 16 July 2019). Thus it may well be a risk to mess with it: science fiction is full of stories of the kinds of chimeras that may emerge, with grave consequences not only to individuals, but indeed even the human race.

The general concerns about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that have bedevilled agribusiness apply even more strongly to genetically modified babies, because, in a literal sense, people are 'playing god'. If some of the modified genes can be passed on to a person's offspring, then there is the possibility of that modification becoming a 'gene drive' affecting entire populations. ""In 2015, scientists proposed a moratorium on inheritable human genome edits that would affect the germline,"" according to Wikipedia, but that doesn't apply to non-human species.

There are proposals to attempt gene drives to force desirable characteristics through populations, for instance, a plan to release genetically modified mosquitoes to drive them to extinction in Florida. The gene modification would cause offspring to die before they reach reproductive age. The plan was abandoned because of risks, including the possibility that mutations would change the edit further. But substantial funding for gene drive technology ($75 million from the Bill Gates Foundation, and $100 million from the US DARPA) suggests that we haven't seen the last of it.

Ethical considerations about public health and the impact on individuals must take priority when policy-makers consider such uses of biotechnology and even pharmaceuticals. It is worth repeating that the risk of unintended consequences looms large. Some may remember the infamous drug thalidomide that was administered to pregnant women to reduce nausea and morning sickness. It turned out that the drug caused many malformed babies to be born, including those without limbs or deformed hearts or eyes.

We keep coming across ethics issues when it comes to medicine. For instance, there is the finding recently (in Too much care? Private health care sector and surgical interventions during childbirth in India, an IIM Ahmedabad working paper by Ambrish Dongre and Mitul Surana) that 900,000 unnecessary Caesarean sections were performed in the private sector in 2016 alone. The motive is quite likely to be money, as a C-section costs Rs 23,978 versus Rs 10,814 for a normal delivery. It may be defensive medicine in fear of lawsuits, too; and some women may want kids on certain nakshatras.

There is also the salutary story of cholesterol. It was vilified for 30 years as the villain in all sorts of heart diseases based on apparently dubious experiments. After urging us all to control our intake of fats, demonising coconut oil, and making an absolute fortune for pharma companies pushing statins, the US medical establishment quietly reversed itself in 2015, and admitted that they had not been able to identify a causal relationship between cholesterol and heart disease. It speaks volumes for the ethics of research scientists, especially at a famous East Coast university in the US.

Then there was the sensational book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou. It is a thriller; it lays bare the shenanigans at Theranos, a blood-testing company, which promised to run an entire battery of tests efficiently and cheaply (not to mention painlessly) on just a couple of drops of blood from a fingertip jab, rather than a big needle being stuck into a vein.

It was the perfect Silicon Valley story, until it wasn't. Its rock-star chief executive officer (CEO) Elizabeth Holmes, a beautiful young woman who dropped out of Stanford at 19, and her chief operating officer, Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani, an older veteran of tech companies, have been accused in civil and criminal cases of lying, cheating and outright fraud. They face many years in jail if convicted.

The company, once valued at $10 billion, ceased operations in September 2018. They had raised a billion dollars, had an all-star board with the likes of Henry Kissinger, George Schulz and Jim Mattis as members, and inked agreements with major pharma and grocery chains to create testing labs in their stories with Theranos machines. The media doted on them.

And then it all went horribly wrong. Theranos seems to be a Titanic that sank on hitting an ethical iceberg. It failed primarily because its technology couldn't cut it; but the hype had become so all-consuming that instead of owning up to their deficiencies, Holmes and Balwani kept building an edifice of lies that finally came crashing down. Their story is a case study in ethics (or the lack thereof): when their proprietary machines proved unable to run the tests, they simply ran them on commercial blood-testing, equipped and pretended the answers came from their own devices.

John Carreyrou, who broke the first sceptical story for The Wall Street Journal, and then persevered for three years as the company bullied and threatened him, the paper and his sources, wonders whether Holmes, the CEO, ""is a sociopath"", one utterly without morals.

These fiascos raise questions about a worldwide epidemic of lack of ethics. In India, we are inured to the fact that politicians, businesspeople, bankers, journalists, bureaucrats, and alas, judges, are not exactly the paragons of ethics we'd like them to be. The vast apparatus of corruption, rent-seeking and patronage-vending have ensured that India is one of the least ethical places to do business in, with only China being worse. The contrast with Japan, where there is a certain sanctity to contracts signed, is telling. There is also a difference with China: they will do unethical things for the glory of the Chinese nation; Indians will betray the nation for a pittance.

Not to accuse Americans of being overly ethical themselves, but they have a point when they claim that the Chinese have been brutally unethical in their practices such as commercial espionage, theft of intellectual property, cyber intrusions/theft, forced technology transfer and non-tariff barriers. They are fighting a total war.

The recent incident of an American fundamentalist Christian stealthily arriving in a prohibited island in the Andamans is also a cautionary tale. The Sentinelese, who inhabit this island, are known to be hostile to outsiders, and there are Indian laws that strictly prohibit contact, in particular because the islanders have no immunity to outside diseases. (One is reminded of how nineteenth century American colonists committed genocide on Native Americans by deliberately infecting them with malaria and other diseases.)

The American intruder, named John Allen Chau, was a medical technician, and so he knew that even minimal contact with the bacteria in his guts would probably be fatal to the entire small community of 60-100 Sentinelese. That didn't deter him: he'd rather convert them to Christianity even if that meant they'd all die;

that didn't matter to him. That man was probably a certifiable sociopath, if not a psychopath.

Plainly, in a world where greed and blind faith are tolerated, we need to create viable ethical frameworks. This is especially true for artificial intelligence, which does not come with a built-in set of ethics or morals or a conscience. Surprisingly, in a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) obsessed world, it turns out that one of the most important issues today is that of a pure humanities subject. Traditional dharmic principles of ahimsa (non-violence), dama (self-restraint), asteya (non-covetousness), saucha (inner purity), and satyam (truth) suddenly don't look so bad. Indian innovators may need to take crash courses in Indian philosophy."

For tickets below Rs 100, the tax has been reduced from 18% to 12% while for those above Rs 100, it has been reduced from 28% to 18%.

This has reference to the news item'Education should be reoriented, says Vice President' (DE, Dec23, 2018) The Vice President has rightly stressed the need for reorientation of the country's education system to reflect the tradition of quest for knowledge and acquiring life skills. There is nodoubt that the education system ought to be such as encourages independent and rational thinking.For this purpose, it is imperative that our system needs to focus more on practical work, use of laboratories and libraries and fusion of technology and tradition, rather than rote learning.To achieve this objective, teachers need to be properly trained and motivated.They must keep in mind that teaching learning for the students should be a funny and enjoyable activity and not a boring one.For this purpose, it is necessary that the teacher creates such a congenial atmosphere in the classroom in which the students find themselves fully involved in the learning process.He/she should have perfect bonding with each and every student and command such a respect that they should consider him/her as their role model.

He should engage all the students in healthy dialogue and ensure that every student is emotionally healthy and is taking keen interest in studies.The teacher ought to guide them, motivate them to think independently and express fearlessly and not to force/her his views on students.A real teacher is one who does not tell the students what to look for but instead guides them how to look for knowledge.He/she should address each student by name and always encourage and appreciate them for their good behaviour.The real teacher is one who never uses bad and negative words for the students, which may lower their self esteem and morale.There is no tailor made plan for class room teaching.A good teacher prepares his /her lesson plan according to the academic level, socioeconomic conditions, aptitudes etc of the students.Therefore, it is imperative that the emotional health of a teacher must be good and he/she should enter the classroom with a pleasing smile,greet the students with a smile and accept their greetings in a pleasant way.The teachers should address the students in a loving and affectionate manner and never use discouraging words to address or assess them.They should accept students as they are and prepare them to meet the challanges of life in an effective manner.This is how effective transfer of knowledge can take place and the classroom can be a funny and enjoyable place rather than a place to be afraid of.

Shehu Shagari, Nigeria's second president, whose civilian tenure was sandwiched between two military rulers in an era rocked by coups, has died. He was 93.

Nigeria's current President Muhammadu Buhari, who unseated Shagari 35 years ago, said on Saturday he mourns ""the departure of a patriot, who served Nigeria with humility, integrity and diligence.""

Shagari had an ambivalent relationship with the military, which initially favoured his ascension to power but held him in solitary confinement for three years after toppling his government.

After military ruler Olusegun Obasanjo lifted the ban on political activity in Africa's most populous country in 1978, Shagari beat regional political veterans in a hotly contested election the next year.

The polls followed 13 years of military rule by four different men.

At his swearing-in ceremony, Shagari said the military had ""succeeded in large measure in unifying us.""

Those years saw a civil war, a toppled civilian government and a series of military administrations including that of Gen. Yakubu ""Jack"" Gowon, in which Shagari served as a civilian finance minister.

Shagari is said to have been the first boy to go to school in his northern village of Shagari in the northeastern state of Sokoto.

He started out as a science teacher before entering politics.

From 1954-1966 he was a member of the House of Representatives and later held a variety of ministerial posts under both civilian and military governments.

Even though the military had voluntarily paved the way for democratic rule, the threat of its interference loomed over Shagari's time in office.

The oil-rich nation's economy suffered from a sharp drop in global crude oil prices, fuelling discontent.

On Dec. 29, 1983, Shagari announced austerity measures in a country already suffering from high unemployment rates and general disillusionment after the oil boom of the '70s.

Shagari's administration also was marred by corruption scandals. Even though the public considered him to be honest, his inability to rein in his government's avarice was sharply criticised.

On New Year's Eve in 1983, a group of military plotters toppled his government, describing Shagari's administration as ""inept and corrupt."" Buhari, then a military ruler, took over the nation.

Shagari, who had been re-elected a few months earlier, seemed to have seen it coming.

""My greatest concern is that democracy survives in Nigeria,"" he told a biographer just before the coup.

It was not until Buhari returned to the presidency in 2015 that Nigeria saw the first peaceful transfer of power from one party to another. The next election is in February.

Maley worked as the British Council's South India (Madras) Regional Director between 1984 and 1988. A well-known author of ELT books and Series Editor for the Oxford University Press (OUP) Resource Books for Teachers series, Maley has also served as the President and Vice President of the International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL), and has taught in the National University of Singapore and at Assumption University, Bangkok. Currently, he enjoys writing poetry, short stories, and ELT books. He was in Chennai recently as a resource person at an international conference organised by SSN College of Engineering.

In this interview, Alan Maley recalls his experience in Madras and shares his views on the importance of creativity in the English language classroom.

In the book , you state that ""creativity is an endangered species in the current model of education, which is increasingly subject to institutional, curricular and assessment constraints"". How important is creativity for teachers of English?

Creativity is enormously important for teachers of English on several levels. One level is what they do in the classroom and also for themselves. It is easy to fall into a routine when you are a teacher.

Doing things differently makes you creative. Thinking about doing things differently and doing things more creatively keeps you alive as a teacher and makes you a better teacher. If you are a creative person, it will carry over into your teaching and your students will also benefit from you and that will give an opportunity for them to show their creativity.

Many teachers still think of creativity as the preserve of a particularly gifted group of people. It is not so. Everyone is creative. Creativity is not beyond one's capacity. Anything can be done in more than one way and the techniques can be very simple and feasible, and they are usable in the classroom. Teachers can develop their creativity which can take many different forms and can be exhibited in many ways such as finding a quicker solution to a problem, narrating something differently, making up a joke, and so on. Yes, creativity is important for teachers because creative teachers can motivate learners and enable them to learn a language in an interesting and effective way.

Tell us more about your recent book?

The book was published in May by Cambridge University Press. It is a collection of 50 classroom activities which teachers can use and adapt in their classrooms.

Should language teachers be trained to become more creative?

First, teachers should know the importance of creativity and should have the desire to become more creative. Teachers should feel the need for being creative. Training is also important. Teachers should be equipped with creative techniques which they can transfer in the classroom. In-service training is as important as pre-service training. Teachers should be taught to generate ideas among learners. It means that they should talk less and create more opportunities for students to speak in the class. Teachers should be creative as well as reflective. Creative teaching and reflective teaching go together.

What is your take on learner-generated material?

It is important to use the learner-generated material in the language classroom. It will be more effective than readymade textbooks. As I said earlier, everyone is creative and learners are also creative. I believe that students are quite capable of generating their own material. They should make students believe that they have the capacity to select materials suitable to them. Learners must be encouraged and involved not only in selecting the materials but also in suggesting language activities. Teachers should give their students a chance to generate their own material. It is a creative process.

How to make language teaching and learning more effective and meaningful?

It is important to make learners feel the need for learning. They learn English for a wide range of purposes but they are not aware of their needs. There should be a shift from ""have to learn"" to ""want to learn"". This shift will motivate them to learn the target language effectively.

How important is professional development for teachers?

I think it is very important as they are prone to fall into habits. So, there is a need for them to keep their mind active. Teacher development programmes give teachers the opportunity to listen to fellow teachers, exchange ideas, pick up others' ideas and use them in their teaching, and learn from one another. They should constantly learn something new and update themselves by taking new courses.

About your association with Dr N S Prabhu who popularised task-based approach to language teaching.

I was fortunate to have had NS Prabhu as a colleague (English Studies Officer) and to see his Bangalore Project at first hand. His task-based approach to language teaching has been much discussed and appreciated by experts in different countries where English is taught as a second or foreign language. His departure from a linguistically-structured syllabus to a procedural syllabus based on a series of carefully staged tasks was a critical moment in the development of our current conceptions of English Language Teaching."

From darkness to light. Or so I thought when I heard about my shifting from the dark dungeons of coal mines, as coal secretary, to the bright lights of school education, as secretary for school education and literacy.

However, I discovered soon that in the coal sector, mining was underground and mafias operated above it, but in the minefield of school education, it was the other way round. All the education mafias existed underground, and they were all masked, masquerading as so-called noble giants. Having taken on some of the mafias of the coal sector and partly succeeded in bringing the sector to order, the task was now to handle these 'noble giants'. It was made more difficult as there was no public outrage against invisible scams in education as was in the case of coal.

Everything seemed to be apparently in order.

To make matters worse, I was the fifth person to hold the charge of secretary in the education department in just two and a half years. Most of my predecessors with impeccable credentials in the education sector did not continue or were not allowed to continue. The government apparently found in me to be the most 'educated' person (I had never worked in this sector except for a brief tenure of three months in 1997 in adult education in Uttar Pradesh) to handle this sector.

It would be an understatement to state that the education sector was in bad shape - both in terms of budgetary allocation and human resource management.

Also read: My friend told me the coal sector was like 'Gangs of Wasseypur': Former secy Anil Swarup

The budgetary allocation for school education was Rs 55,115 crores during 2014-15. This amount got reduced in subsequent years. For instance, the allocation for 2016-17 was Rs 43,554 crore.

On the human resource front too, the situation was alarming. The department had five secretaries between 2014 and 2016. A number of joint secretaries were also changed during this period. It was like musical chairs reminiscent of my days in UP where it was rumoured that the only industry flourishing was the transfer industry.

In the two biggest states of the country, the positioning of top management followed a peculiar pattern. Whereas in UP, there were two additional chief secretary-level officers manning school education and secondary education separately (creating huge coordination problems), in the state of Bihar, one officer looked after both the education and health departments. Consequently, the health of education continues to suffer.

In addition to this, the mafias were having a field day, eating into the system, like termites. Fortunately, like all mafias, those in the education sector too were not a majority, but played a dominant role in decision-making. They were extremely well connected and deeply entrenched. There were a host of mafias, but the prominent ones were operating in these areas:

There are around 16,000 B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges in the country. A large number of these exist only in name. If you pay them well, you can get a degree without an effort. It was rumoured that if you pay them more, they could even arrange for a 'naukri' (a government job). Action was initiated by then chairman of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Santosh Mathews, an upright officer, by issuing notices to all the colleges to furnish the details of their existence on affidavits. The idea was to ensure that only those that actually existed got recognition and in case of wrong information they could be prosecuted. It worked initially, but the colleges realised that quite a few of them could be in trouble. Despite the support he got from most of the states, he was put under enormous pressure by the mafias who took the 'judicial' route to pin down the chairman. He had to quit.

In a few northern states of the country, a number of examination centres are given on 'theka' (contract) for copying. These centres are highly 'priced' as they facilitate mass copying or cheating during examinations. The current chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath, came down heavily on this mafia. This was last done by Kalyan Singh in 1991, but thereafter no chief minister could dare to do that. Consequent to the steps taken in UP in this year's exams, more than one million students chose not to give exams. It is a reflection of the 'addiction' to mass copying.

The publishing industry thrives on the education sector. People with vested interests want to maintain status quo as this benefits them. It happens at two levels. As respective state governments provide free books to students, there are various ways in which money is made. The 'mandatory cuts' in getting the books printed centrally constitutes a substantial portion. The initiative taken by the UP government in 2018 and the consequent savings thereunder lends credence to this allegation. The Bihar government is toying with the idea of direct benefit transfers recognising the 'dealings' inherent in central printing and distribution.

The other level of money making is done by a handful of private publishers who enter into an 'arrangement' with the private schools in the name of quality, and compel the students to buy almost four to five times more expensive books as compared to the NCERT ones. If all the students of around 20,000 CBSE-affiliated schools were to source NCERT books, there would be an estimated annual expenditure of around Rs 650 crores. Compared to this, if they source books from private publishers, it would cost around Rs 3,000 crores per annum. The difference is too great to justify the quality argument.

The NCERT did a wonderful job in the current academic year to ensure that books were available on time so that the students were not compelled to buy expensive books, but this effort will need to continue. The NCERT will always be under pressure from people with vested interests to be 'inefficient'.

Most of the private schools in India contribute enormously to imparting quality education. However, some of them are bringing a bad name to this segment. There are some extremely powerful individuals who are able to get away with the most immoral things in education. They violate various norms, legal and ethical, with impunity because having been part of the official machinery at some point in time they know the tricks of the trade.

Irrational hiking of fee, charging huge sums of money to 'lend' their brand, harassing the brand assignees are some of the many tricks they practice. The chairperson of the CBSE Rajesh Chatur who chose to take them on was shown the door in 2017. His successor, Anita Karwal, one of the finest civil servants, was also set to be 'sacrificed'. But she held her ground despite pressure.

The good news in all of this is yet again from UP where the state has enacted a law on the fee regulation after consulting all the stakeholders. Hence, the legislation has been welcomed by all. Hopefully, other states will follow suit.

During the more than one and half hour long meeting at the Raj Bhawan Jammu, each Vice-Chancellor was given time for presenting brief overview of his/her respective institution after which the Governor made remarks for better and transparent functioning of these universities, sources added.

As the issue of Jammu University land under Army occupation also came up during the meeting, the Governor asked the JU Vice-Chancellor Prof Manoj K Dhar to take up the matter with Divisional Commissioner Jammu for necessary action in this regard, sources disclosed.

While chairing the meeting, Governor directed the Vice-Chancellors that Academic Calendar for each Academic Session should be issued well in advance and all the backlogs if any must be cleared for avoiding inconvenience to the students besides streamlining the system. He also stressed that biometric attendance should be a compulsory feature of the Universities even as no time frame was yet fixed for adopting the same.

Even as the Governor stressed for further improving teacher- student ratio, he, however, made it clear that selection procedure for the teaching positions must comply with the UGC norms. He further stated that stringent quality control measures should be introduced in the B Ed colleges affiliated with the universities.

Taking keen interest on enhancing sport infrastructure at the campuses, the Governor stressed that sports and extracurricular activities be encouraged as an integral component of University education and in this regard, he advised that the annual Inter University Sports meet be made a regular feature.

According to an official spokesman, Governor also laid stress on promoting entrepreneurship among the youth and suggested that Universities may introduce suitable courses in this area. He emphasized focus towards introducing vocational and entrepreneurial courses for the skill development of the students.

The Governor also stressed that gainful benefits under RUSA must be maximized and all higher Education Institutions must ensure NAAC Accreditation. He emphasized upon all the Universities to enhance their research capabilities and to update the syllabus regularly so as to keep abreast with rapidly changing global developments. He observed that there should be a State level Advanced Research facility with latest equipment for promoting research in the new and innovative areas.

Governor advised the Farm Universities to undertake innovative research in improving seed varieties particularly oilseeds and pulses and suggested that measures be taken for reducing the yield gap between the farmers' field and the experimental plots of the Universities by deputing a team of researchers for finding out reasons for such variations and addressing them suitably. He also stressed strengthening of extension services and rapid transfer of technologies to equip the farmers with latest know-how.

He received a call on Monday which he misunderstood as a friend's call and became an easy catch for the fake caller.

The fraud caller took advantage of the misunderstanding and told the teacher that he wanted to transfer some amount in the teacher's account. The caller asked for the bank account number and the teacher informed him that he didn't remember his account number. Then the caller asked for his ATM card number. The teacher informed that the card was not in his pocket but at home. This call took place between 12:30 and 3:30.

Later when the teacher reached home, he got a call again and this time the teacher Dilip gave his ATM number to the so called ""friend"". He even gave the CVV number to the caller. After a little while the teacher got 3 messages on his mobile which indicated that amount was withdrawn from his account in 3 attempts, the total amount being 47,900 rupees.

Currently, the varsity has only vice-chancellor S Japhet, registrar Ramchandra Gowda and registrar of evaluation as permanent teaching staff. However, they have the responsibility of handling official work as well.

During the trifurcation of BU, faculty members were asked to choose one of the three universities. Seventeen of them picked BCU, but the proposal to transfer them to the varsity is still pending with the government and higher education department. ""As a result, the staff is still juggling between BU and BCU. We are completing the courses with the help of guest faculty when required,"" said Japhet.

T hese faculty members are still working under the BU payroll and following the same syllabus. According to BCU office-bearers, the university requires 37 teaching and 100 non-teaching staff to cater to students' needs.

""For the new session, we plan to add about 10 new departments and need to fill around 194 vacancies. We are drafting the proposal and will submit it to the government and higher education department soon,"" added Japhet. The new departments would include law, cinema studies and life sciences , among others.

Speaking about the staff crunch, MCom student Shreya P said, ""It has been about one year and we are yet to know who our permanent teacher is. Classes are never held in continuity and we are forced to rely on seniors' notes.""

Fund crunch another worry

Not just staff crunch, the university is also hit by fund cru nch despite BCU officials running from pillar to post to get Rs 7.5 crore, which the varsity was promised by the government after trifurcation. This has affected development work like revamping of laboratories, opening of new departments, housekeeping and security. ""But that won't suffice. We will propose a one-time grant of Rs 100 crore so that all needs of the institution can be met,"" said Japhet.

According to the university's records, it was sanctioned Rs 5 crore during trifurcation by the government, Rs10 crore by BU, which it has received. Later it was sanctioned Rs 25 crore, of which Rs 7.5 crore is still pending."

There are no trained counsellors on campus, and it's largely left to ""overburdened"" teachers to look after the welfare of students. And yet, it's the teachers and staff who have ended up facing the flak for the 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs).

An investigation by The Indian Express has revealed that in at least 32 of the 49 suicides reported from 2013 to 2017, disciplinary action -- censure, increment cut, suspension and transfer -- was initiated against either the school principal or teachers or both.

Of the 32 cases in which disciplinary action was taken, only 10 could be directly attributed to the actions of employees who were punished, according to data obtained by The Indian Express under the RTI Act and verified separately with vidyalayas from where the suicides were reported.

The Indian Express reported Monday that the reasons behind the suicides in JNVs range from family problems, unrequited love, depression, homesickness, academic pressure, humiliation by teachers and fights between friends.

However, the onus of spotting behavioural changes, suicidal tendencies and depression in a student is on the school principal and the House Master (HM) at these institutions run by the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), an autonomous body under the HRD Ministry tasked with running all 635 JNVs.

READ: Navodaya Vidyalayas Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh: 'Have proposed that govt deploy two full-time counsellors in each school'

Such an approach fixes the blame and not the problem, say JNV principals, who spoke to The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity.

""The Samiti's instinctive reaction to a suicide is to act against the House Master and principal, even if they are not responsible for it. Principals are already under a lot of pressure to deliver good board results and teachers are overburdened with non-academic work. To expect us to also know what's going on in every child's mind is unreasonable,"" said the principal of a JNV in north India that witnessed a suicide in 2017.

An HM is a school teacher tasked with leading a 'House' that consists of a group of students. There are usually eight Houses for boys and two for girls in a JNV. The HM is suppose to be ""a parent, guide, philosopher and friend"" to each member of the House.

According to an 11-page circular issued by the Samiti in 2016 -- when suicide figures hit double digits (12) for the first time -- the HM and AHM (Assistant House Master) are supposed to interact with students regularly to assess their emotional well-being, gauge their family history through informal chats and involve the school principal if they notice behavioural changes.

Counselling sessions can be arranged ""on need basis"" for a student with suicidal tendencies, the circular states. It warns of stern action, stating that ""any negligence/ indifference/ laziness in terms of the implementation of these guidelines will be viewed seriously and the responsibility will be fixed on the employee concerned"".

However, an evaluation of the Navodaya system by Niti Aayog, released in March 2015, shows that JNV teachers are already overworked and overstressed. The study, which covered 112 teachers in 56 schools across 16 states, states that teachers are overworked because of ""house mastership and mess management"" responsibilities, which ""severely eats into the teaching time"".

Dr Rajesh Sagar, a psychiatrist with AIIMS-Delhi, says asking teachers to look for early signs of suicidal tendencies in students is not an effective preventive measure. ""Unless you are trained to spot subtle changes in behaviour, a teacher who is already pressed for time may not be able to see it,"" he said.

According to Samiti sources, roughly 200 JNV teachers, or less than 2 per cent, of the total strength of 16,000, have completed the NCERT's PG diploma course in clinical counselling over the last 15 years.

Defending the disciplinary action taken against employees in case of suicides, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh told The Indian Express: ""We are not victimising anyone. Action has been taken only in those cases where a systemic failure or error was noticed after an inquiry.""

Advertising

In the last one year, the Samiti has tried recruiting wardens for boys' hostels since it was noticed that a majority of the suicides were by boys. Also, it recently submitted a proposal to the HRD Ministry to have two full-time counsellors in each school -- while that is being discussed, another eight suicides have been reported so far this year."

The 29-year-old, who has shown his work twice at the Lakme Fashion Week and was named one of the finest GenNext fashion designers, is content to work from Saharanpur and not move to a bustling big city. Mazhar justifies his choice by saying he finds his narratives and context here, he resists accepted notions of a high-profile career, and, above all, has the courage to put this small town on the fashion map of the country.

It all started when as a class nine student, Mazhar set up a boutique with his senior in school. The senior's father had a boutique.

In 2017, Mazhar's first collection, called Dhobi Ghat, evoked nostalgia about his hometown. The washerwoman Sakina Begum, a regular visitor at his home, used to make a small mark on the clothes. The whites of his collection had these marks that Sakina, along with 30 other women, pressed on to the clothes to make a design. The next collection used darn or the craft of the rafugars.

""My inspiration is the Indian artisan, especially those indirectly contributing to the fashion industry like the dhobi or the rafugar,"" he says.

Saharanpur is known for wooden handicraft and Mazhar's family is one of the many engaged in this business. ""Coming from a conservative Muslim family, it wasn't easy to say that I wanted to be a designer,"" he adds.

Today, he runs his label under the national rural employment guarantee programme and more than 70 people work for him. In his design, the visual language is distinctly made up of small-town life and the ways of the artisans there.

Rahul Mishra invokes his village, Malhausi, in his collections on display at the Paris Fashion Week. Just like Mazhar, nostalgia is the primary moving force in his designs too. The broken door, where his mother used to hang a white curtain with its daraz work filtering the afternoon sunlight symbolising a diffused state of being with those white curtains shielding him against the world. His intimate relationship with the things of his childhood-pillow cases, curtains, table cloth, the white of his grandmother's dhoti, the little pond, dew drops and the white and blue checks of the lungis of the weavers and the butchers in his sleepy village in UP-are all part of his storytelling as a designer.

While India's fashion story is shaped by designers who come from little towns and villages and set up shops in Delhi and Mumbai like Samant Chauhan, who is from a small place near Jamalpur in Bihar, or Sanjay Garg of Raw Mango, who hails from Mubarikpur, there is also another set of designers who are choosing to live and work in their small towns and reaching out to the world with their crafts via social media and e-commerce. Like in Kochi, Kerala, 32-year-old Sreejith Jeevan says he is moving towards ""unfashioning"" and it is the joy of slow-paced life that inspires his designs and collections. ""We're moving so fast that sometimes we have absolutely no time for little things such as raindrops and birds.

Though being far from the fashion capital of the country comes with its own drawbacks, there is nothing like the feeling of being home, doing the work you love in a place you know. ""Today, fashion is everywhere and is no longer limited to the metros,"" says Jeevan, who studied at the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad, and then at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (ENSAD), Paris. He launched his label Rouka in 2013. ""My stories have a local flavour for a global audience,"" he says.

Dream Merchant: Jeevan at Origins, a collaborative project with locals to make designs for Chendamangalam Kaithari, a weaving cluster (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

After the devastating floods in Kerala this year, Jeevan, along with some other designers, helped the weavers of Chendamangalam, near Kochi in Kerala, who had lost their livelihood, get on their feet with the launch of Origins.

""How can my people make fashion for the world-that's what I ask myself,"" he says.

With sustainable fashion and craft becoming the buzzwords of the industry, it is no surprise that designers are looking back at their experiences and creating a new design vocabulary, along with social consciousness and an urgency to be innovative with local crafts and contexts. Take, for instance, Bihar-based social entrepreneur and designer Praveen Chauhan, who set up MATR-Motherly. Luxury. Artistry, a social enterprise in Bodh Gaya, his native place. The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) alumnus collects discarded flowers from the Mahabodhi Temple and transforms them into natural dyes with Kathy Williams, who is from Australia and the founder of 'Because of Nature', a sustainable clothing label. Together, they have founded the Happy Hands Project. ""I always tell artisans that it is your right to expect from us. You are the people who kept our art, craft and culture alive. The artisans have taken me to a different level of creativity. So many people from other countries approach me to study traditional Indian textile and handicrafts,"" he says.

""Thousands of people visit the Mahabodhi Temple every day and offer hundreds of kilograms of flowers. Though this project is at its early stage, we have been able to employ 30 women from the surrounding villages,"" he says.

The Happy Hands Project is an initiative started as a collaboration between the Bodhgaya temple management committee, MATR and Because of Nature to bring sustainable employment to the people through natural dyes on khadi made in Bihar. The project aims to promote the skills of artisans to produce high quality khadi and garments for national and international designers and retail brands that utilise traditional skills.

People used to make fun of him, saying that he was studying tailoring at a high cost after joining NIFT. His father, a contractor, supported him against all odds. Today, Chauhan is credited with reviving khadi, along with other ventures.

Forty-eight-year-old Vijayalakshmi Nachiar grew up in a 'Kutchi' family and was introduced to the world of embroidery and textiles at a young age: Her family had been cotton traders for generations. She graduated in textiles and clothing from the SNDT Women's University, Mumbai.

After marriage, she moved to Pollachi on the outskirts of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, an agrarian town with a rich tradition of woven cotton sarees.

Her husband started growing ecological cotton through his contract farming initiatives in 2005. And, in 2008, Nachiar set up a handloom studio and co-founded Ethicus in 2009.

""I think I can do what I am doing today with Ethicus only because I come from a small town. This would have been impossible in a big city. I have an in-house production facility and local craftsmen work here. Living in a rural area has enabled us to work from farm to fashion,"" says Nachiar.

When they launched Ethicus, there were very few handloom brands and the challenges were many. ""Customers were willing to pay high price for silk but not for good cotton,"" she says.

Woman Power: Vijaylakshmi Nachiar at her studio in Pollachi

Today, her venture is listed by the textile exchange as one of the few brands worldwide using 100 per cent sustainable raw material and adopting a sustainable method of production. It has been awarded the 'Future Shaper' prize by textiles exchange in 2012 and the 'Pride of Tamil Nadu' award in 2017, instituted by the Round Table of India, as an emerging retail brand.

Naushad Ali's story is similar. ""My dad was a textile merchant and I grew up with all kinds of fabric around me. We used to have bundles of fabric from all over India stocked up in our living room, and I used to help my father tag them all. That was my introduction to textiles and fashion,"" says Ali, 33. Unsure of being accepted as a designer, Ali gave himself five years when he launched his label at Puducherry. ""The lifestyle, landscape, culture and people I meet every day have all been great inspirations for the label and shaped me as a designer. 'Made in Pondicherry' has given me an identity in the industry,"" he adds.

""We are committed to being a sustainable label, with a difference. Being part of fashion, the second most polluting industry in the world, I want to take my decisions carefully and consciously-from the choice of materials to what we make out of them. I believe in slow fashion, creating something that lasts and is also something meaningful,"" he says.

Slow and Steady: Naushad Ali at the beach in Puducherry (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

Born in Vellore, Ali spent his growing up years in Chennai and Bengaluru, before his parents moved to Puducherry. He wanted to be an astrophysicist and was also good at botanical drawings. But once he got through NIFT, Chennai, he knew he would do something entirely different.

In 2014, he set up Studio Liam in Auroville to revisit and transfer the expertise of Indian craftsmen to contemporary fashion. His definition of fashion: there is no hurry, there are no seasons, there's only time and commitment. In 2017, three years after he launched his label, he received the prestigious Grazia Young Fashion Award (Sustainable Wear category). And in 2018, he was chosen to represent India for the first IFS biennale at London Fashion Week, 2019, supported by the London College of Fashion and Somerset House.

Pankaja Sethi, 39, spent her childhood at different places-from Itanagar to Chennai-as her father was the chief medical officer with the CRPF. A graduate in botanical science and a NIFT alumnus, after working for export houses, she was asked by a former teacher to help document the folk arts and narratives of Jharkhand. That was the beginning of her foray into indigenous textiles. She relocated to Odisha to help with design intervention and work with tribal weavers.

Rare Tribe: Pankaja Sethi with adivasi women at the Lakme Fashion Week, Mumbai.

It was not an easy task to enrol artisans to create textiles because some of them had fallen in the trap of mass production and many of them did not want to create contemporary concepts, fearing it wouldn't last, she adds.

""Being located in Bhubaneswar, I now see the merits of living in a place that is pollution-free and with much less traffic on the roads compared to metro cities. Moreover, I am close to the weavers and the tribals, who create indigenous textiles and crafts. And, above all, I see the importance of local traditions at the global level,"" she says."

After the admission of the case yesterday, lawyer PT Sangma who is representing the family, stated that the WP has been admitted by the Chief Justice who at the motion stage has directed the police to file a show cause as well as provide the report of the police investigation so far in the next hearing."

There is no doubt that the school education sector is beset with huge problems. However, whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or there are other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs is a moot point.

Let us first try to understand what has not happened in the education sector. Why has it not happened? And, how can it happen (whether through policy intervention or otherwise)?

Two things have certainly happened during the current millennium. The infrastructure (school buildings) has shown remarkable improvement though there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the mid-day-meal, we have managed to get the child to the school.

However, what is appalling is the poor quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools. This is evidenced by the fact that the learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite enormous amount of investments. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels.

However, this does not solve the problem of quality. To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of eight million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in skewed distribution of teachers in most of the States as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little on this front. In fact, the legislation made the task of delivering quality education complex and difficult. The focus of the Act is primarily on 'inputs' (like infrastructure) rather than 'outcomes'. It has created an adversarial role between 'public' and 'private' schools. The Act mandates under Section 12(1)(c) that even private schools ""shall admit in Class I, to the extent of at least 25 per cent of the strength of that class, children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group."" The manner in which reimbursement is to be provided has created a number of problems.

The norms and standards prescribed in the schedule for a school are far removed from ground reality. What is perhaps desirable has been made mandatory. This has resulted in a phenomenal increase in the number of teachers. During 2015-16, there were 39,608 government schools that had less than 10 children but each school was mandated to have minimum of two teachers.

The budget private schools, most of whom are doing a great job in imparting education, are under enormous pressure to meet the prescribed standards or face closure. No attempt was made while enacting this legislation to look at the ground reality.

The consequences have been disastrous. On an average, an amount of around ₹10,000 per child gets spent in government schools. The budget schools do it for much less and impart as good, if not better, education. Unfortunately, the focus so far has primarily been on regulation (legislations are perhaps meant for that) and not on development of the private sector. Consequently, even after eight years of enactment, the country is none the better than what it was.

The RTE Act has done more damage to delivery of education. Section 16 of the Act provides that ""No child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till completion of elementary education.""

The 'expulsion' part can be understood but not holding back a child in a class has meant that a large number of children are getting promoted without acquiring the necessary attributes. The model of 'no detention' was apparently picked up from the West and transplanted in this country without taking into account the objective conditions obtaining here.

Yet again, the consequences have been devastating as there is a huge bottleneck getting created at Class X where the pass percentage has plummeted. The States were not even given freedom to take a call on the issue. The government has subsequently decided to provide an option to the States and the amendment is under consideration of Parliament.

A new Education Policy is round the corner. However, what needs to be understood is whether there is a need for a policy to address the issues that afflict school education. Most of the action relating to education lies in the States. In any case, the country is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, he could well be ""lynched"" but in some of the States of northern India, they consider it their right not to go to the school. There are instances of these regular teachers employing a ""substitute"" to represent them and even teach on their behalf.

What is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining: What needs to be done? How it will be done? Who will do it? And, by when it will be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed. One has often wondered why should only the Centre assess the performance of States? Why can't it be the other way round?

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, to transfer and posting, to engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, to their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at.

An action plan for each State will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the Centre and the respective State government. Intervention for each State will vary from State to State. Unlike the present dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among States. The whole approach has to be outcome based rather than input based as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, Holland and all the lands of the world but not at motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country but has so far gone unnoticed. ""Policy"" cannot help in this regard.

What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these home-grown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice.

What is also required is to learn from States, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable State level interventions both administrative and financial.

Policy debates provide food for intellectual stimulation but what matters is what is done on the ground. Hence, the dire need for an action plan."

The flagship SUV of the brand in India offers a lot of features and takes on the likes of Toyota Fortuner in the market. However, it is a five-seater SUV and targets only the niche customers.

Bollywood actress, Chitrangada Singh was seen enjoying the new SUV with an off-roading trainer at an event in Mumbai. Volkswagen India keeps on organizing such events for its customers and prospective customers and the actress was a part of the event and seems to have enjoyed the session quite a lot.

The trainer is explaining how to do slides on the vehicle. There is a camera that records the whole conversation and the trainer can be heard saying ""Lift off the foot from the accelerator and slam the brakes while turning the wheels to slide"". Chitranganda can be seen following his instructions and her expressions say it all about the slide. The vehicle can be seen going sideways and it sure felt great. The caption to the video says that Chitrangada Singh got it right in the second attempt and then repeated the same manoeuvre twice after that.

Here is a video from the event, where you can see Chitrangada Sen posing with the Tiguan for photographers, and then taking the SUV out for the slide.

Coming to the Volkswagen Tiguan, it was launched last year and Volkswagen sold as many as 800 units of the SUV in just 6 months after the launch. The Tiguan became immensely popular in the Indian market. The all-new SUV is based on the Volkswagen's MQB platform and is assembled at the Aurangabad, Maharashtra plant of the brand. Even though it is a five-seater, it is priced at Rs. 27.49 lakhs, putting it in the luxury segment. The top-end version is priced at Rs. 30.88 lakhs.

The Tiguan is powered only by a diesel engine in the Indian market. It gets a 2.0-litre TDI turbocharged engine that produces a maximum power of 141 bhp and a peak torque of 340 Nm. It gets a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission as standard. However, only the top-end variant gets the 4WD system. There is no low-ratio transfer case on the Volkswagen Tiguan though.

Off-roading can be a fun task but only when you know what to do and how to do it correctly. Doing manoeuvres only on the basis of instincts can turn out to be ugly and the vehicle can get either badly stuck or can overturn. It is important to always try these moves with a professional trainer or an experienced off-roader. There are quite a few off-roading experience zones in India where professional drivers are available to guide you and teach you. Just like Chitrangada Singh, who never seem to have done a slide in life, a right teacher and a safe environment to learn can make things much easier and better."

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over £2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul Botoşani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some £200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above £30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to £3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino Sigüenza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of £4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education.

Beginning in 1968, India has had two education policies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government constituted a committee under the chairmanship of late T.S.R. Subramanian to evolve a new policy. By the time the committee submitted its report, the Union HRD minister was changed.

So, another committee was constituted, this time under the chairmanship of K. Kasturirangan to formulate the new education policy. In July this year, the committee got a third extension.

The current government has only a few months to go. One fervently hopes that this report also does not meet the same fate as the one by T.S.R. Subramanian.

However, the key question is whether there is a need for a new education policy at all? It is undoubtedly true that what has so far happened in the education sector leaves a lot to be desired. What also needs to be considered is whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or are there other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs? What is the rationale for a new policy in the school education sector?

During the past decade, the educational infrastructure (like school buildings) has certainly shown remarkable improvement, although there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the midday meal, we have managed to get the child to the school. However, the quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools has left a lot to be desired.

The learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite an enormous amount of investment. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels. However, this has not solved the problem of quality.

To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of 8 million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in the skewed distribution of teachers in most of the states as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little to salvage these shortcomings. In fact, in some cases, like no-detention policy and mandatory provision relating to qualification and number of teachers, it created more problems than it solved. A tedious process of amendment had to be resorted to correct some of the wrongs.

Most of the action relating to education lies in the states. Moreover, India is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, there are chances that he or she will be punished, but some states in northern India are notorious for teacher absenteeism. Although the situation is now improving, it remains a big challenge in many states. Many teachers get away with playing truant. There are also instances of teachers employing a 'substitute' to represent them and even teach on their behalf. What quality of education can be expected from such so-called substitute teachers?

Can a new education policy solve the problems that beset this sector? Problems vary from region to region. If policies were to solve the problems of the country, they would have all been solved long ago. There should be just a short policy statement outlining the objectives: Providing quality education to every child in the country. Instead, what is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining what needs to be done, how will it be done, who will do it, and, by when will it be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed.

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood, and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, transfer and posting, engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at. An action plan for each state will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the central government and the respective state governments.

A beginning was made in this regard for the states of Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. The one relating to J&K is apparently being implemented, but UP is languishing. Such plans will have to be made for and in consultation with each state and their execution closely monitored. Intervention for each state will vary.

Unlike the current dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among states. The whole approach has to be outcome-based rather than input-based, as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the Western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, New Zealand, Holland and all the lands of the world, but not at our own motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country, but has so far gone unnoticed. A new 'policy' can't help in this regard. What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these homegrown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice. What is also required is to learn from states, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable state-level interventions both at administrative and financial levels.

Policy debates are always welcome and should happen, but what is required urgently is an action plan in consultation with all the stakeholders as has been done for a couple of states already. What is required is making things happen on the ground.

Lok Sabha

The day began with the CPM and Congress giving adjournment motion notices -- handed in to stay the business of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, which can be moved with the consent of the Speaker -- in Lok Sabha over the Rafale deal and demonetisation respectively.

Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan conducted the proceedings amid sloganeering and ruckus. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) was protesting against the construction of a dam across the Cauvery river. Congress MPs were demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into the Rafale deal, and the TDP sought to raise issues related to Andhra Pradesh.

When the Lower House convened for the day, more than 40 members from the three parties trooped into the Well, holding placards and shouting slogans. BJP MPs also sought to raise certain issues from their seats.

As the day went on, Congress MPs demanded a joint parliamentary committee investigation into Rafale deal, which forced both Houses to adjourn. ANI quoted Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge as saying: ""We want JPC as we will only get to know everything when Parliament members sit and look into the files. JPCs were formed in the Bofors and 2G cases as well. How can there be a typo? Had it been one word, it would've been understandable, an entire paragraph can't be a typo.""

Kharge added that there were ""irregularities and corruption in the way the Rafale deal was signed."" He pointed out the loss of technology transfer to HAL, as well as the loss to the national exchequer. He demanded a JPC probe to ""fix accountability"". ""Kindly allow this and all details will come out. Every file will be checked by Parliament, not the Supreme Court,"" he said.

Multiple BJP leaders rejected the need for a JPC probe into the Rafale deal, saying that the Supreme Court had made it clear that there were no irregularities. The saffron party then demanded an apology from Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. Health Minister JP Nadda then introduced the surrogacy bill to the Lok Sabha, saying it's a historic day and that all parties wanted commercial surrogacy to be stopped to prevent exploitation of women.

Amid sloganeering and chaos, discussion on the bill ensued. BJD leader Bhartruhari Mahtab said that the surrogacy bill does not define the ""close relative"" who can become a surrogate mother. He also pointed out that the bill does not mention the legal recourse a couple can adopt if their plea for surrogacy is rejected. Adding to the discussion, NCP MP Supriya Sule noted that the five-year ""cooling period"" clause in the bill is not conducive as medical tests can be done to prove a couple's fertility or lack thereof. She also said: ""Sometimes a fertile couple may not have children due to medical reasons, they should not be left out.""

She also noted that the provision of surrogacy only applies to married couples, and that other family structures are ignored. ""If single parents are allowed to adopt, they should be allowed to have surrogates as well."" She concluded by calling it a ""good bill, but not modern enough."" As the din got louder, the Lower House or Parliament finally passed the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill 2016. Mahajan announced that the Consumer Protection Bill will be discussed in Thursday's session.

Rajya Sabha

The proceedings got underway peacefully in the Upper House. The Rajya Sabha was to discuss two important bills related to the education sector. Union Education Minister Prakash Javadekar was to move that the National Council for Teacher Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018 be passed. He was also to introduce the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018 for consideration and passing.

The Rajya Sabha was disrupted consistently, causing Chairman Venkaiah Naidu saying that it was clear members were not ready to allow the House to run smoothly, and adjourned the session for the day. Both Houses will convene at 11 am Thursday.

The Rajya Sabha will not function from 24 to 26 December, so that members can celebrate Christmas back home, Naidu said minutes before adjourning the House. ""Let's utilise the time properly,"" he said, taking a jab at certain MPs.

The House was adjourned earlier amid more 'JPC' sloganeering by Congress leaders. After Mallikarjun Kharge said an inquiry will ""fix accountability"" and protests growing louder, the House was adjourned till 2 pm.

Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu adjourned the House for the day, saying it is 'clear you don't want the House to run and I don't want people to see this. The Lok Sabha has been adjourned till noon. When the sessions commenced for day 7 of the Winter Session of Parliament, the atmosphere is peaceful in the Upper House, but Speaker Sumitra Mahajan was conducting the proceedings in the Lower House amid sloganeering and ruckus.

The Congress and the CPM have given an adjournment notice for today even as proceedings in both Houses of Parliament were disrupted for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday over various issues, including the Rafale fighter jets deal.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Congress give adjournment motion notices in Lok Sabha over the Rafale deal and demonetisation respectively. The adjournment notice is handed to request an Adjournment Motion, which is the procedure for adjournment of the business of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, which can be moved with the consent of the Speaker.

However, the debate is unlikely to continue with both Congress and BJP sparring over the induction of French made Rafale fighter jest in Indian Air Force. The Congress has alleged that the government struck a deal to buy overpriced jets and randomly assigned offset partners to help its businessman friends. The BJP, meanwhile, is buoyed by a Supreme Court order which refused to look into the defence deal.

In the legislative business, the government will try to move and pass the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2018, The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016, and The Nationa Medical CommissionBill, 2017 amid others.
