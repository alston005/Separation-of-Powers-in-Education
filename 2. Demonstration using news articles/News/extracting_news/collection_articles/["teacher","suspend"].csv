Two days after he and his brother were suspended from primary membership of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), MP Dushyant Chautala has challenged his uncle Abhay Singh Chautala to suspend three party MLAs in Haryana. These MLAs include his mother Naina Chautala.

""He has suspended an MP and now should also dare to suspend three MLAs. I know he will not do that as he is afraid of losing his servants, vehicle and the tag,"" Dushyant Singh Chautala said in Chandigarh, on Sunday.

Ajay Singh, father of Dushyant and Digvijay Singh, had floated a new party by the name Jan Nayak Janta Dal.

Brothers Dushyant Chautala and Digvijay Chautala were suspended from the primary membership of the INLD after allegations of indiscipline, hooliganism and anti-party activities were levelled against them.

State President Ashok Arora said that both -- Dushyant and Digvijay -- were spreading disaffection against the party leadership during birthday Celebrations of Chaudhary Devi Lal in Gohana on October 7.

Supporters of Dushyant and Digvijay Singh had repeatedly interrupted their uncle Abhay Chautala and grandfather OP Chatala's speech during birthday celebrations.

INLD state president Ashok Arora said that OP Chautala did not need any ""outside evidence"" to decide about suspensions as he had witnessed the ruckus on October 7.

Arora added the decision was diificult for the Chautala patriarch as it was about his family members.

The rift between Chautalas may cost a lot to the INLD which is struggling to return to power in Haryana.

The announcement of the Jan Nayak Janta Dal has not only divided party's cadre votes in two, but has also weakened the party organisation.

The INLD has a vote share of about 30 per cent in 60 out of 90 seats in the Haryana Legislative Assembly. It recently joined forces with the Bahujan Samata Party (BSP) which has a vote share of around 7 per cent.
