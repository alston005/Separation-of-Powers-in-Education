"5202","","HYDERABAD: Even as the State Education Department is mulling permanent closure of Azaan International School, parents have asked the department to reconsider the decision as it would impact academic prospects of 1,600 children studying in the school. The department is considering closing down the school after two children were found to be allegedly raped/molested there.

The school has been shut for the last 10 days. On Wednesday, as many as 162 parents met the DEO and requested her not to close down the school. They fear changing school in the middle of the year would be difficult and pose financial and logistical issues. Zareena Shah, mother of a class 10 student, says though the sexual harassment charges cannot be dismissed, future of other students cannot be overlooked.

""An investigation is going on and the DEO should allow classes to continue under her supervision,"" she says. ""If there were lapses on the part of school management, take action against them. But, don't shut down the school,"" says Zareena. Ameen Mirza, another parent, says parents are worried about both the safety of their children and their academics.

Meanwhile, the school management has sent its response to the second notice from the DEO office. The management is learnt to have stood by its stand that there are no lapses from its side but has not substantiated it with any documentary proof. ""In view of the serious nature of the incidents, closure of the school appears to be the most likely action. But we are looking at all possibilities. We don't want any child to be affected,"" said a senior official and ruled out the possibility of changing the management and running the school.

""The final decision on the fate of the school is likely to be taken later this week based on both incidents and the reply of the school. Though the parents refused to give any evidence or even produce the child before the inquiry committee in the second case, both incidents are being taken into account,"" said B Ventaka Narasamma, DEO.

'35L students to be affected if budget schools are shut down'

Unhappy at the government's refusal to issue extension of temporary recognition (ETR) without insisting upon different No Objection Certificates -- fire, traffic and GHMC, the Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) has called for a bandh of all budget schools on Friday. The term budget schools refers to schools which charge fee less than Rs 30,000. According to the TRSMA, the National Building Code came into force in 1998, fire NOC became mandatory in 2005 and traffic NOC from 2009 onwards, therefore nearly 80 per cent of schools established before these norms were enforced are now found to be violators. S Srinivas, president of TRSMA, alleged that the government is deliberately tightening the noose around the budget schools in order to shut them.

""As part of its KG to PG education programme, it plans to open up 500 more schools next year so they want to shut our schools. We are ready to even hand over the management of our schools to government so that it can run them government schools and regularise all our teachers too,"" he said. There are 35 lakh students in 1,200 budgets schools across the State and closure of these schools will affect their future.","Some parents don't want Azaan school in Hyderabad to be closed","955615541","2018-09-26","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/sep/27/some-parents-dont-want-azaan-school-in-hyderabad-to-be-closed-1877748.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

The management has been found guilty of lying -- its claim that it has initially approached the police to inform about the rape of the UKg students, education department officials have not found any documentary evidence to support this claim. This is in addition to other violations cited under GOMs 1 like failure to secure campus and the entry and exit points, running school sans proper affiliation, among others

As reported in Express second notice was issued to the school management two days after it received the reply from the correspondence. The school has to send its reply within seven days giving reasons as to why the Education Department should not hold it liable for lapses and shut the school.

Despite, the alacrity with which the DEO office has handled the enquiry in the issues, a report has not been submitted to the commissioner and director of school education. Speaking to Express T Vijaya Kumar, commissioner, CDSE, said that he is still awaiting a report on the issue from the DEO. "" Once we get the report action will be taken as per the existing Acts,"" he said.

"5205","","Vairavankoil Panchayat Union Middle School on the outskirts of the town was closed on Thursday after the Block Educational Officer (BEO) declared local holiday for the school, ostensibly due to the village temple festival.

A teacher, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed that the school was closed only due to the local temple festival, but enquiries revealed that the temple festival was held on Wednesday and the Headmaster (in-charge) secured local holiday on Thursday to enable teachers to attend the wedding of the son of the Headmistress, who was on medical leave.

After Headmaster (in-charge) Karthikeyan sought local holiday, citing temple festival and enclosing resolutions adopted at School Management Committee and Parent- Teacher Association meetings, the BEO, in his order issued on August 29 (date overwritten), permitted the Headmaster (in-charge) to declare local holiday.

The Headmaster (in-charge), in his request, sent on August 24, sought permission for announcement of local holiday in view of the village temple festival on Thursday. However, enquiries with the villagers revealed that the 'mulaipari' festival at the Kooni Amman Temple was held on Wednesday.

Consequently, the school functioned when the villagers celebrated the festival and remained shut on Thursday to enable the teachers to attend the wedding of the Headmistress' son, a villager said.

The school authorities, however, maintained that they went by what the villagers said and did not cross check the festival date. When contacted, Chief Educational Officer R. Murugan said local holiday was granted for the school following the order of the BEO. He said he would check if there was any discrepancy.

Eight teachers were working in the school, which had a student strength of about 80.

"5208","","In a desperate bid to save their institution from being closed, students of Alaghatta government high school in Chitradurga district travelled 250km overnight and met chief minister H D Kumaraswamy on Monday morning.

Donning their uniform and clutching schoolbags, 43 students, including a fair sprinkling of girls, arrived near the CM's residence in JP Nagar around 5am.

After meeting the students around 10.45am and giving them a patient hearing, Kumaraswamy ordered officials to ensure that the school is not shut down.

The students said they were told by the authorities on June 16 that their 24-year-old school would be closed and they would be shifted to a school in Bharamasagara, which is 15km away. According to the children, classes for this academic year have already begun. While admissions for class 8 were under way, lessons for classes 9 and 10 were being imparted.

Officials cited the poor strength of students -- the Alaghatta school has about 50 of them -- as a reason for closing the institution and relocating the students to Bharamasagara.

Accompanied by villagers, the distraught students left their village around 11.30pm on Sunday night. Around 8.45am, the CM's officials collected details from them.

When the CM was about to leave in his car around 10.45am, the students called out to him. Drawn by their 'CM Saar"" cries, Kumaraswamy stopped, met the kids and assured them that their demand would be met.

He also asked villagers why they had brought the children to the city. The villagers replied that they didn't have an option as no one paid heed to their grievances.

The CM has sought a report from officials on the number of students in the school.

Gram Panchayat member of Alaghatta, E Nagaraj, said education department officials were helping the private school lobby by shutting down the decades-old school. ""We protested against the department's decision for a couple of days but no one bothered to listen to us.

"5209","","Fort Lauderdale: A gunman carrying a shotgun in a guitar case opened fire at a Florida high school, wounding one student as other students and teachers piled desks and cabinets against classroom doors to make barricades. The 19-year-old suspect was later arrested and apologised as he was led away in handcuffs.

Ironically, Friday's shooting at Forest High School in Ocala happened on a day planned for a national classroom walkout to protest gun violence. A 17-year-old boy was taken to a hospital for treatment of a non-life threatening wound to his ankle.

The suspect, Sky Bouche said ""sorry,"" followed by ""it doesn't matter anyway"" to reporters as he was led from the school in handcuffs by several deputies. Authorities said Bouche was a former student at the school. ""I didn't shoot anyone,"" he said to reporters. He ignored most of the other questions until asked what he'd say to the victim. That's when he said, ""Sorry.""

A shootout took place at the Forest High School on Friday. AP

The shooting comes just over two months after a gunman killed 17 people and wounded 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Nikolas Cruz, 19, faces the death penalty if convicted in that Valentine's Day shooting.

It also coincided with a nationwide student walkout to protest gun violence on the anniversary of the 1999 massacre at Colorado's Columbine High School. The Ocala school had planned its version of a walkout, students said.

Chris Oliver told the Ocala Star-Banner that his 16-year-old son, a Forest student, told him the shooting happened near his classroom. The boy told Oliver the shooter stood in a hallway and fired at a closed classroom door. The shooter then dropped the weapon, ran and tried to hide, the boy told his father.

Craig Ham, deputy superintendent of Ocala schools operations, said the gunman carried the shotgun in a guitar case into the school by blending in with students. Ham told reporters the shooter fired at the bottom of a locked classroom door, and pellets struck the victim in the ankle.

Jake Mailhiot's psychology class had just begun on Friday morning when school officials announced a ""code red"" alert over the intercom.

""You could hear in their voice that this wasn't a drill,"" the 16-year-old junior said. Prepared for such alerts, students and teachers leapt into action to barricade the classroom's one door and block the door's window. ""Our teachers started pushing file cabinets and desks toward the door, and a few friends and I joined in,"" Mailhiot said. ""We also started tying together some jackets to hang out the window, in case we needed another way out.""

In a photograph Mailhiot shared on social media, the classroom door is invisible behind a tall pile of furniture. Mailhiot said about 15 people in the classroom waited over 30 minutes to be evacuated by Ocala police. They were instructed to leave with their hands up, he said.

Marion county sheriff Billy Woods praised the quick response by the school resource officer, as well as school personnel and first responders.

In the Parkland shooting, school resource officer Scot Peterson retired amid accusations that he didn't do enough to confront the Stoneman Douglas gunman.

The Forest resource officer, Marion county sheriff's deputy James Long did not hesitate. ""He went right in,"" Woods said at a news conference. Woods said Long heard a ""large, loud banging sound"" and immediately responded.

The sheriff said the Bouche wasn't injured, wasn't fired at and was arrested without resistance. ""Marion county does everything to protect their children,"" Woods said.

Afterward, all students were taken by bus with a police escort to First Baptist Church of Ocala, where parents gathered to pick them up, officials said.

Rachael Carter was at the church waiting to be reunited with her daughter, a 10th-grader who turned 16 this week. Carter's pastor called her when he saw a post on social media. ""I'm shaking like a leaf in a hurricane,"" Carter said. Forest High has an enrollment of more than 2,000 students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

"5210","","Educationist Iffat Faridi wants NIOS to alter its policy so that vulnerable students can go beyond Class 9 -- the last class where they are given questions in Kannada

For students like Maya, a Std 4 dropout from a Kannada medium school, the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) would seem like a Godsend.

Far removed from the rigid structure of conventional schools that require compulsory attendance, the NIOS allows for students to have access to education, with many conveniences, distance being one of them.

When Maya, who could read, write and speak fluently in Kannada, heard about the NIOS, she thought it was a dream come true. She could continue her education despite the gap and her long-cherished dream of getting a school certificate would be fulfilled. However when she decided to enroll herself in NIOS for the Std 10 exam, she realised that Kannada was not included as the medium of instruction for Std 10, although up until Std 10, it is. At the Std 10 level, students like Maya would have to choose either Hindi or English as a medium of instruction, for study material and for questions papers.

However, she was told that she could answer the question paper in Kannada since she was not fluent in Hindi or English.

The most crucial exam of a student's life had become a battle of languages.

Fortunately, students like Maya, have in Iffat Faridi, an educationist and a resident of Bengaluru, a saviour who understands the challenges of studying in one language and being tested in quite another. And Faridi is leading the fight for giving girls like Maya the advantage of doing their Std 10 exams in a language they have fluency in.

Besides taking education to the people from underprivileged sections of society, Faridi is championing the cause to have Kannada as one of the languages of instruction in the NIOS system for Std 10.

Speaking to BM, Faridi said, ""A blessing in disguise, the National Institute of Open School plays a pivotal role in the distance education system of India. It is a ray of hope for children who are not fortunate enough to join regular schools or who could not continue their schooling. Despite its obvious significant contribution to the Indian education system, NIOS has a serious issue in its system which needs to be highlighted and must be resolved,"" she added.

Not just Maya...

She recounts the story of Renuka, a child of a migrant labourers from Gulbarga district, who is facing similar issues. Renuka started her schooling almost at the age of 10, after going through bridge courses based on modules developed by the Azim Premji Foundation in Kannada, Environmental studies and Math. She was admitted to a Kannada medium school, and initially enrolled in Std 1 as per rules. Later, based on performance tests conducted by the school, she was promoted to Std IV. At the moment, the 14-year-old wants to apply for Std 10 exams through NIOS and she faces the same issues as Maya. She has good command over Kannada but will have to master Hindi or English to learn the study material.

Faridi's fight

Says Faridi, ""Lack of study material in Kannada is a huge setback and injustice to the aspirations of those children who have done schooling purely in Kannada medium. Kids referred to NIOS belong to a class where parents are daily wagers. They earn very little and that too after working very hard from morning till evening. These children have taken the initiative for further education, on their own. Having travelled a fair distance on the road to being fully literate, they are facing setbacks in their path due to non-availability of study material in Kannada. They need full support from NIOS to pursue their dream of completing their education and get on a career path.""

NIOS reacts

When BM contacted Chandrashekar S, director of NIOS, Bengaluru branch, he said, ""There is Kannada up to 10th. The 10th class study materials and examinations will be bi-lingual and the students can answer in Kannada. There is no problem in that. The next set of Kannada books are getting ready. Once it is released, students will be getting it.""

KDA slams the system

Reacting to the limitations for Kannada medium students in NIOS, SG Siddaramaiah, Chairman, Kannada Development Authority told BM, ""What kind of unscientific methods are these? How can someone who knows only Kannada be made to read in English or Hindi and again write answers in Kannada? How is it even possible? Who is going to punish these type of people who deny access to education to Kannada medium students? This is coming to light now. What about all these years? Thousands of children have been denied education only because of this option.''

While Faridi continues her fight with NIOS, she's preparing her students to brace themselves for the language challenge ahead. She has already brought Hindi books from Delhi to prepare her students to learn from study materials in Hindi and English at the Std 10 level.

Why Open School?

Students who fail to qualify for regular school or are unable to pass a class despite multiple attempts have the option of completing studies through Open School. Also, mature students who wish to return to school after a break in studies or those children who have to shoulder the family's burden pursue studies through Open School.

Are questions set only in English or Hindi?

No. Seven other options are available apart from English and Hindi. These are Urdu, Marathi, Telugu, Gujarati, Malayalam, Odia and Tamil. Note that all South Indian languages are available except for Kannada.

Can they learn and answer in Kannada?

Yes, but only till Class 9. In Class 10, the questions are set only in Hindi or English which is highly unfair for students already struggling with the system.

How many students benefit from Open School?

Last year, 1,64,192 students completed Secondary (equivalent to Class 10) through Open School. Around 500 students study in Kannada each year.","Closed minds in Open School and one lady's struggle for Kannada - Bangalore Mirror - ","832571514","2018-03-16","http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/cover-story/closed-minds-in-open-school-and-one-ladys-struggle-for-kannada/articleshow/63322728.cms","Bangalore Mirror",FALSE

Andhra Pradesh is witnessing a statewide shutdown today, February 8, after the Left parties called for a bandh to protest against the Union Budget 2018.

The parties said that the budget, presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley, was ""injustice done to Andhra Pradesh"" and that the government also betrayed the people of the state.

"5214","","The Robert Money school at Grant Road closed its doors in 2017. File pic

The charity commissioner has asked Mumbai police to conduct an inquiry into the abrupt closure of the 180-year-old Robert Money School at Grant Road. The school was run by a charitable trust offering affordable education, and has now been replaced by an international school with comparatively exorbitant fees. While activists have alleged that the Bombay Diocesan Trust Association leased the school plot illegally, the trustees claim it is all above board.

The school had been under a cloud for the past few years, after it started shutting down one class each year by stopping admissions. Each time, the administration spoke of closing the school, but continued to operate after protests by parents and locals. However, 2016-17 was the last year it functioned, finally closing its doors in 2017-18.

The charity commissioner's request for an investigation follows a complaint by the Christian Reform United People Association, which has been fighting to keep the school running since 2013. Cyril Dara, secretary of the association, said, ""This school has been here for around 180 years. It was also the first technical school in Maharashtra in the 1950s, at which time the state government had allotted considerable grants to the trust. Moreover, the school was named after the then education secretary, to provide affordable quality education to local children. Now, the trust has handed over the land to a third party to run a new school.""

Melwyn Fernandes, secretary of the Association of Concerned Catholics, Mumbai, said, ""Portuguese and British settlers had donated land to the Christian community to set up educational and religious institutions. The police should take action against culprits for illegal dealings of the school plot.""

On the other hand, Rev. Amolik, secretary of the Bombay Diocesan Trust Association, said, ""The school shut down gradually because there was no demand and the number of students taking admission kept dropping. Now another school is running there. There is absolutely no irregularity, as the transfer was done following all regularities and was registered at the collector's office. Some people with vested interests are maligning the trust.""

Pandharinath Patil, Inspector (Crime) from D B Marg police station, said, ""We have not received any intimation on the matter yet. Once we do, we will see what needs to be done. However, since it is about a transfer between schools, the education department should look into it and then file a formal complaint.""

"5216","","Pulling up education authorities over the appalling conditions at a private school here where toilets lacked doors and roofs, the Madras High Court today ordered its closure and directed that all the students be shifted to nearby schools.

Passing interim orders, Justice S Vaidayanathan noted that toilets in the school were open to sky and did not even have doors and said since high-rise buildings were close-by, miscreants may take photographs of girl students using the toilets and circulate them on the internet.

The judge said he was not inclined to grant permission for continued functioning of the 'Sri Saravana Vidhyalaya Nursery and Primary School' at suburban Puzhal for a period of one academic year to carry out the rectifications.

He ordered that all the students studying in the school be accommodated in the nearby schools.

Accepting the direction, the special government pleader submitted a list of eight schools located in the vicinity.

The matter relates to a petition from S Sasikumar, who submitted that the management of the school functioning in his property, had obtained approval and renewals from educational authorities by fraudulently misrepresenting the actual safety and infrastructure and sanitary conditions.

He sought a direction to authorities for inspection of the school.

Following an earlier direction, Director of Elementary Education A Karuppuswamy and other officials were present before the court today.

The judge said there were also other deficiencies like asbestos sheet roof and thatched huts and asked the government pleader as to how permission was granted to such a school.

He wondered if authorities will act only if an incident like the 2004 Kumbakonam school fire, in which several children died, occurred.

Pulling up the educational officials for not taking steps, the court said though a show cause notice was issued in 2015, no further action was initiated.

"5217","","MANGALURU: A Kannada medium school which was on the verge of closure a few years ago in a remote village of Bantwal taluk is now so packed that it had to turn away 150 students this academic year.

Thanks to the collective efforts by villagers of Karenki, the Daddalakadu Government Higher Primary School is now up and running. The turnaround came through after the Kannada medium school decided to offer education in English, totally free of cost, to nearly 500 children.

According to Prakash Anchan, a textile merchant and the man who spearheaded the turnaround along with other villagers, the school headmaster apprised village elders in 2015 that the school was on the verge of closure as the enrolments were down to a trickle. ""In a rare gesture, members of Sri Durga Friends Club in the village decided to save the school by pulling out their children from English medium schools. The students were then admitted to the Kannada medium school, taking the total number of students to 56 from 36. It increased to 230 the following year, and in 2017, there were 350 children studying in the village school. In 2018, the number rose to an unbelievable 500. The school had to cap the admissions at 500 because of infrastructural limitations,"" said Anchan.

""I bet no other Kannada medium school would've ever sent back children stating shortage of seats. Villagers who believed that real change begins from one's own home are to be credited with the success of the school,"" he added.

According to Anchan, the perception that English medium schools are meant for the rich should be challenged. ""We are changing that perception by providing everything free of cost to the children in this school,"" he said. Daddalakadu Government Higher Primary School has classes from LKG to 8. The free service includes books, uniform, education and concessional transport.

In the past three years, the faculty added about 15 teachers, besides the government-appointed five. The village club pays all the 15 guest teachers. Apart from academics, children are being trained in singing, dance, yoga, computer and other extra-curricular activities. There are three buses for transportation. ""We pay them salaries from our earnings and donations. No government fund has been taken so far,"" said Anchan.

In a nine-kilometre radius of the government school, there are about nine private English medium schools. ""There was stiff resistance from them initially. We were denied permission to start an English medium but still we are fighting for it,"" says Anchan who is confident that the state government would back them.

Infrastructure call for an upgrade

Daddalakadu Government Higher Primary School, started in 1979, is crying for repair and refurbishment. Work on Rs 2.5-cr infrastructure upgrade is progressing fast. ""We began construction work without worrying about the funds. However, with generous donors around, funds flowed in for the work. The new building will be completed soon, and it would help us to raise the enrolments to 1000 students and add two more classes till SSLC,"" said Anchan.","Govt Kannada School on verge of closure now has packed classes - Times of India","905876663","2018-07-15","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/govt-kannada-school-on-verge-of-closure-now-has-packed-classes/articleshow/64995856.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Thousands of people have signed a petition to prevent the closure of one of the UK's largest independent Hindu faith schools, the Swaminarayan School in London. The Akshar Educational Trust, which runs the school set up in 1992, had announced its closure last month as part of plans to exit the education sector completely by July 2020. Parents of students associated with the school have now organised a campaign to save the ""school of excellence"" from closure.

""In a letter to parents, a spokesperson for the school blamed 'increasing regulatory requirements, difficulties in recruitment and retention of teachers, ready availability of free state-funded Hindu schools, and declining pupil numbers' for the move. This is simply not true,"" notes the Change.org petition, which has attracted nearly 3,500 signatures since last week. ""Sensitivity analysis of accounts by experts suggests that with restructuring it is possible for school to run for the foreseeable future,"" it notes.

The parents, who have coordinated into a save-the-school campaign, say that many Indian-origin families have moved, relocated and changed their way of life to enable their children to get an education within the ethos and culture of Hinduism at the respected Swaminarayan School in Neasden, north-west London. ""Parents are more than happy to consider taking over the running of the school by appointing new teams who will give due consideration to the communities and families that are being disrupted by this announcement,"" the parents said in a statement.

The school has been very popular within the large Indian-origin community based in the borough of Brent, many of whom are happy to pay the GBP 4,310 per-term fees to enrol their children. But the trust running it said that mounting pressures in recent years had hampered its ability to invest in the resources required to sustain the improvements needed in the school, both educationally and for its infrastructure.

The institution, opened by Pramukh Swami Maharaj alongside the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir to ""promote Hindu and British culture and values and way of life"", has around 400 pupils between the ages of three and 18 currently on its rolls.

The trustees had unveiled plans for closure in two phases in order to allow parents time to apply to other schools. However, parents are furious at the lack of consultation before the announcement was made. ""The school is not a business, where a decision like this can just be made and announced... the team of governors and trustees just seem to have had enough and this is now the easiest option for them,"" the parents said.

They have received the backing of Indian-origin Labour party MP, Seema Malhotra, who said she is ""saddened"" by the news of the closure. ""The Swaminarayan School has a strong reputation and has been highly valued by parents and the community. I hope that through discussions between parents, teachers, governors and trustees that a solution can be found and the school is able to stay open and continue to flourish,"" she said.

"5220","","One of the UK's well-known privately-run Hindu faith schools here has announced its closure from July next year due to increasing regulatory requirements, declining pupil numbers and difficulties in recruitment and retention of teachers, a decision which has left parents surprised and disappointed.

The Akshar Educational Trust, which runs the Brent-based Swaminarayan School, said in a statement that it plans to exit the education sector completely by July 2020.

It blamed increasing regulatory requirements, difficulties in the recruitment and retention of teachers, ready availability of fee-free state-funded Hindu schools, and declining pupil numbers for the decision.

""It is indeed very sad, particularly for our pupils, staff and parents. We explored several options before arriving at this difficult decision. We have given all parents one year's notice to find an alternative school as well as a commitment to our staff that their employment is secure for the academic year 2018-19,"" said Jitu Patel, Chair of the Trust.

The Swaminarayan School, set up in 1992, is popular within the large Indian-origin community based in the borough of Brent in north-west London, many of whom were willing to pay the 4,310 pounds per-term fees to enroll their children.

The news of its closure has been received with surprise and disappointment by the parents, who will now have to look for alternatives from the next academic year.

But the trust said that mounting pressures in recent years had hampered its ability to invest in the resources required to sustain the improvements needed in the school, both educationally and for its infrastructure.

Nilesh Manani, Head of the Senior School since it opened, said: ""The children and staff are some of the very best I have had the privilege of supporting and we will strive to ensure that our education standards are maintained until the very end.""

The trustees have planned two phases for the closure of the school, associated with the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sanstha (BAPS) Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden one of the world's largest Hindu temples outside India.

The closure timetable is intended to give a full academic year's notice in order to allow all parents time to apply to other schools.

The prep school and senior school will continue as normal from September 2018 until closure in July 2019.

This applies to all pupils, except those taking state-level exams known as the General Certificate of Secondary Educations (GCSE) or A-levels in September 2018, who will all be able to complete their GCSEs and A-levels at the school until July 2020, it said.

The Trust also said it had held discussions with the Avanti Trust, which is already looking for a suitable site to open a state-funded Hindu school in the area.

""If the Avanti Trust is successful in opening its school by September 2019, parents will be able to apply for places available at that school subject to meeting the school's admissions criteria,"" the Akshar Educational Trust said in a statement.

Umesh Raja, Head of the prep school, said: ""It is very sad, but the most important thing now is for everyone to work together over the next two years, especially for the pupils remaining at our school.""

"5221","","BENGALURU: In a desperate bid to save their institution from being closed, students of Alaghatta government high school in Chitradurga district travelled 250km overnight and met chief minister H D Kumaraswamy on Monday morning.

Donning their uniform and clutching schoolbags, 43 students, including a fair sprinkling of girls, arrived near the CM's residence in JP Nagar around 5am. After meeting the students around 10.45am and giving them a patient hearing, Kumaraswamy ordered officials to ensure that the school is not shut down.

The students said they were told by the authorities on June 16 that their 24-year-old school would be closed and they would be shifted to a school in Bharamasagara, which is 15km away. According to the children, classes for this academic year have already begun. While admissions for class 8 were under way, lessons for classes 9 and 10 were being imparted.

Officials cited the poor strength of students -- the Alaghatta school has about 50 of them -- as a reason for closing the institution and relocating the students to Bharamasagara.

Accompanied by villagers, the distraught students left their village around 11.30pm on Sunday night. Around 8.45am, the CM's officials collected details from them. When the CM was about to leave in his car around 10.45am, the students called out to him. Drawn by their 'CM Saar"" cries, Kumaraswamy stopped, met the kids and assured them that their demand would be met.

He also asked villagers why they had brought the children to the city. The villagers replied that they didn't have an option as no one paid heed to their grievances.

The CM has sought a report from officials on the number of students in the school.

Gram Panchayat member of Alaghatta, E Nagaraj, said education department officials were helping the private school lobby by shutting down the decades-old school.

However, keeping in mind the Bibek Debroy Committee report with its suggestions to stop offline activities like running educational institutions, the future of Railways schools is now unclear.

Significantly, RMHSS is the top performer among the schools under SR jurisdiction. This year 34 students (16 girls and 18 boys) appeared for the Class X examination. Top performers of this school suggested Indian Railways should continue running schools. ""I am very proud of my school and support from theteachers helped me to secure good marks. The Railways must not close this academic institution and should continue running its schools. I am sure our school would again come up with excellent results in the near future,"" said Aathee Akshaya, the RMHSS Class X topper.

Currently, about 300 students are studying at the school and the institution is expecting to start a Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) batch this year. ""We are expecting to get CBSE affiliation to start classes I to VIII. This would increase the student strength of the institution, but many parents are worried the Railways would close this school,"" said an employee.

Meanwhile, sources informed Express it would not be possible for SR to close the school. Even if the Railways decides to stop offline activities, it would probably hand over the institution to Kendriya Vidyalaya or Navodaya.

However, many parents are not ready to take the risk with their wards' futures at stake.

The committee was constituted in June 2017 to ""identify the problems and prepare guidelines to simplify the process/procedure for grant of Essentiality Certificate/Scheme of Management /Recognition/ Up-gradation to Private Unaided Schools in Delhi.""

The committee's decision is vital as in February 2018, the Delhi Government had ordered private schools functioning without DoE recognition to discontinue all educational activities from the next academic session beginning from April 1, 2018.

In a response to two RTIs filed separately by Chandrakant Singh and Gaurav Tyagi, General Secretary and Joint Secretary, respectively, Private Land Public Schools Association, inquiring about the committee's decision, the DoE replied with ""no such recommendations were submitted till date.""

The purpose of the committee was also to ""examine the provision of Delhi School Education Act & Rules, 1973, RTE Act 2009 and the suggestions received from school management/societies/trusts running Private Unaided Schools in Delhi.""

""The committee was constituted to simplify the existing procedure, not to amend the Act. The committee is still in existence and examining the provision. Probably in a month or two, it may finalise a decision and announce it,"" said a spokesperson from the DoE.

Singh and Tyagi argue that in the wake of closure threats issued by the Delhi government to unrecognised schools in the city, where lakhs of students are studying, the committee's say in the decision-making process could save thousands of schools from closing before the start of the new academic session.

Chandrakant Singh, had also sent a letter to Delhi Education Minister and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia requesting him not to close any of the unrecognised schools until a decision was taken by the committee.

The request was then forwarded by Sisodia's office to the DoE, asking Director Saumya Gupta to ""look into the matter for taking appropriate action"".

"5225","","As a petition against the closure of unrecognised schools is expected to be taken up in the Kerala High Court on Wednesday, the Association of Minority Management Institutions, an organisation representing owners of educational institutions run by minority groups, has urged the government to take a stand in their favour.

P.M.A. Salam, Indian Union Muslim League leader, and one of the functionaries of the association, told the media here on Tuesday that around 3,000 schools across the State had been served closure notices by the Education Department. Though the department was claiming that the schools were not providing the facilities as mandated by the Right to Education Act, Mr. Salam alleged that the schools were not given enough time to act on the requirements.

""When the Act came into force in 2013, the United Democratic Front (UDF) government had asked unrecognised schools to either fulfil the obligations or close down. Around 1,000 schools managed to get recognition after officials examined the facilities. This government, however, is arbitrarily asking us to shut down without giving us a chance,"" he alleged.

The schools facing closure included those approved by the Central Board of Secondary Education and functioning for over two decades. Education Minister C. Ravindranath had claimed on the floor of the House that 1,585 schools had been served notice, of which a majority were run by minority groups, Mr. Salam added.

Nisar Olavanna, president of the association, accused Education Department officials of adopting a hostile attitude towards the managements, affecting the future of lakhs of students, teachers and non-teaching staff. Asked about the allegation that the teachers and other staff were being paid a meagre amount as salaries, he said that only a few schools were resorting to such tactics.

"5226","","Kendrapada: Every morning, in Kendrapada town, a single student makes his way to a 104-year-old school. He is taught by just one teacher. After school, the student and the teacher shut the gate and walk back home.

In March of 2019, when the last teacher of the Abhaya Ayurvedic school retires, the doors of the seven classrooms will close, once and for all, bringing to an end the lonely march of the town's singular Sanskrit institution.

The Ayurvedic school was established in 1914 by noted Sanskrit scholar and Ayurvedic practitioner Sudarshan Das. In 1956, noting its popularity, the government took over the school management.

""The school's past is glorious. Many of the school's students have become Ayurvedic doctors, Sanskrit scholars, writers and poets,"" said Rabi Narayan Pati, a retired school teacher and an old boy of the school.

Three years ago, the Central human resource development ministry constituted an expert committee in its attempt to revive interest in Sanskrit and age-old Ayurveda practices, but such measures have not seeped into the prospective students of the town, said Pati. ""With the number of students thinning, the school has been struggling for survival for a while now,"" said the alumnus. He is echoed by Ayurvedic practitioner and former student Dr Balabhadra Das. ""It is hard to believe that a school that once bustled with teachers and students is now on the verge of closure,"" said Das.

Basudev Suar the only teacher of the school has - for all his life - been encouraging parents to send their children to this school. ""But nobody is interested to study Sanskrit. Ayurvedic science too is not a field towards which parents wish to push their children,"" said Suar.

Suar's comments come at a time when Ayurvedic science is seeing a renewed interest. ""In Kerala, Ayurvedic remedies attract so many. Yet an institution like this suffers for want of students,"" said Kali Prasan Nayak, a retired teacher. The only student of the school, Diptiranjan Barik, now studies in Class X.

""The school used to provide Sanskrit along with Ayurvedic lessons for students from Class VI to X,"" said Suar.

When contacted, district education officer Dr Udayanath Majhi said the school has long since been accustomed to decline. ""As per the order of the government, a school cannot function with fewer than 25 students.

"5227","","PARADIP: Members of PPL DAV Parents' Committee on Wednesday criticised the authorities of Paradeep Phosphates Ltd (PPL) for making false statement over closure of Odia DAV Public School in its township area.

Committee president Sriballav Kar alleged that the clarification of PPL management that they have no intention to shut down the school is false. He said the allegation by PPL regarding non-submission of road map to enhance the quality of education by DAV is fabricated as the school authorities have already submitted it. Similarly, the DAV school authorities have denied the other charges made by Chief Operating Officer (COO) of PPL Vishwajeet Kumar Sinha on February 5, Kar added.

After the PPL's 30-year agreement with DAV management expired in January, a meeting was convened hurriedly on January 17 where the COO had expressed unwillingness to run the school on PPL premises. Later, the PPL authorities levelled charges against the DAV over the issue. Even on February 7, officials of another private educational institution visited the school premises, he informed.

Kar said on February 10, the authorities of Bhubaneswer-based DAV Public School had conducted a meeting with principal of PPL DAV School SK Das over the matter. During the meeting, it was found that a draft copy of the proposed agreement for renewal was submitted to PPL by DAV in May 2017. The agreement was supposed to be renewed in May 2017, but it could not work out due to some unavoidable circumstances, he added.

"5228","","Pune: The education minister as well as the secretary of the department have refused to divulge details regarding the NGO that worked on the survey report, responsible for the decision to close zilla parishad schools where attendance was poor.

The report has also not been made public, triggering concern among retired educationists and activists. In fact, activists are of the opinion that the report should be made public at the soonest so that it is made open to scrutiny.

Mukund Kirdat, an education activist working against the decision to close schools in remote areas, pointed out that any document affecting the education of such a considerable number of children should be made public.

""It looks like there is a vested interest in not sharing the name of the NGO and making the report public. Secondly, there are also rumours that certain corporate entities will be allowed to run these schools a their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity,"" said Kirdat.

Kirdat further went on to mention that for a government trashing reports of NGOs such as Pratham, taking such a big decision without any review process on its own also seems rather fishy.

""When the report came out, the government should have formed a committee comprising a civil society member or an activist, a retired judge and a government official in order to review the report and take samples to ascertain if the report is, in fact, true or not,"" said Kirdat.

Matin Mujawar, another education activist, explained that the top-down decision will only hurt rural Maharashtra in the long run. ""The problem with this model is that someone sitting in Mumbai has come to a decision whether the schools in these villages should be shut or not, without even knowing what is happening in villages. These decisions should be taken with utmost care and field officers must ensure that they recommend the name of the schools where an alternative is available to the seniors rather than vice versa,"" said Mujawar.

According to a zilla parishad teacher, the entire issue has created a fear among tutors as well as parents whose children attend these schools.

""Once the name of your school is on the list, we don't know what will happen next. Parents continue to ask us and we don't have an answer to their questions.

"5229","","Pune: In March last year, the Japanese government shut down a train station on the island of Hokkaido after a girl, who had to take a train to school, finally graduated. The entire station had been kept operational for three years, just for one passenger.

Back home in Maharashtra, the remote village of Kalakrai is now faced with the prospect of sending its young children on a two-hour trek through thick woods to another school after its only school was ordered to close.

Only 70 km from Pune, this village of 200 residents is almost cut off from the outside world. The nearest motorable road is two hours away on foot. The isolation is so acute that most women here have given birth at home.

A team from TOI had to carefully make its way through the forest to reach Kalakrai - two hours from Sawale village, where the new school is located. During the rains, numerous waterfalls and streams hide some massive boulders. The path, lined with thick undergrowth, is slippery and dangerous. When the school shuts, the children of Kalakrai will be forced to take this route to the nearest school, every day.

The government's order has been aimed at zilla parishad schools with student strengths of 10 or fewer. Kalakrai doesn't stand a chance.

""Class I has just one student; Class 2 has three; there are only four studying in Class III; and just two in Class IV. There are indeed 10 students, but in total,"" says Suryakant Talpe, one of the two teachers at the school.

Parents, stunned by the closure order, are furious. ""The only government facility we have is that school. How can they shut it? Don't we deserve some semblance of a system here?"" asks Shobhaji Kavale, whose grandson is one of the two children in Class IV.

The tiny one-room school was built 20 years ago. It has no functioning toilet and its roof is near collapse. Inside, however, there is evidence showing the teachers and the kids had tried to make the most of what they were given. Common English and Marathi words have been spelt out on colourful charts.

"5230","","The Kerala government has issued an order against Peace International School for allegedly propagating communal content. The Chief Minister's Office issued an order to the Director of Public Instructions (DPI) asking the latter to take necessary actions to shut down the institution.

""In order to prevent Muslims from joining IS activities, it is highly necessary to stop the operations of such institutions,"" read the letter.

The school managed by Peace Education Trust had come under the scanner after reports emerged that the school was promoting and teaching communal content.

In 2016, the state police registered a case against the principal and other trustees of the school under Sections 153A and 34 of IPC.

A probe conducted by the Ernakulam district education officer revealed that the school was teaching no secular content.

Top sources in the Chief Minister's Office told India Today that ""we cannot let anyone destroy the secular nature of this country. The school was not following any of the approved syllabi.""

""The school was not affiliated to CBSE, NCERT or state syllabus board. The findings by the district collector were shocking as the school was trying to inject communal divide in young minds. We cannot let this happen in our country,"" said the top official, who wished to remain anonymous.

Even before this allegation, the school was in the eye of storm after two of its employees reportedly joined ISIS.

Abdul Rashid and his wife Merin Mariam were among the 21 people who went missing from Kerala and have reportedly joined ISIS. Abdul Rashid was working as the PRO and Merin was a teacher in the school. After marriage, Merin converted to Islam and embraced the name Mariam.

Based on the letter from the Chief Minister's Office, Directorate of Public Instruction will now issue a closure notice to the school.

However, the representatives of the school management refused make a comment in this issue, citing that they have not got any official confirmation from the state government.","Kerala govt orders closure of Kochi school for promoting, teaching communal content","791551757","2018-01-10","https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-government-shuts-down-school-to-prevent-muslims-from-joining-isis-1124018-2018-01-06","India Today",FALSE

"5232","","The Kerala government on Thursday ordered the closure of a chain of schools for its alleged radical curriculum aimed at disrupting communal harmony.

Peace International School that runs a chain of schools in the southern state faced a police probe after it was found that at least three of its staff were among the 21 people who left their homes in 2016 to allegedly join Islamic State.

""We were really shocked to see some of the content. They propagated extremist ideology and carried details of so-called atrocities against Islam,"" said a member of the panel that examined the school curriculum. The member didn't wish to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media.

The school management criticised the government's decision, based on reports filed by the education department and Ernakulam district collector, as ""a vilification campaign aimed at tarnishing a well-managed minority educational group"".

The group has 10 schools in Kerala and one each in neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Initially the school in Ernakulam will be shut down. Other branches would be closed after accommodating students in other schools, government sources said.

The probe panels found that though the schools were affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), they taught books compiled by Burooj Realization, a Mumbai-based Islamic educational institute.

CBSE schools typically use books published by the State Council of Educational Research and Training or the National Council of Educational Research and Training.

Some of the content was radical and promoted enmity on the basis of religion and race, the probe found.

Police had raided the Ernakulam branch in 2016 after they go to know that a teacher at the school, Merin Jacob alias Mariyam, was among the missing 21 and a case was registered against the group for promoting enmity on the basis of religion.

Five of the missing people were converts to Islam.

Similarly, Yasin Ahmed, who was arrested from Delhi airport allegedly on way to Turkey to join Islamic State, taught English at the Malappuram branch.

The alleged leader of the missing group, Abdul Rashid, was a public relations officer with the school chain.

The school chain was founded in 2006 by MM Akbar, a Muslim preacher, often referred to as Kerala's Zakir Naik, the Mumbai-based evangelist who is on the run now.

Akbar, who lives in Qatar, has not responded to police notice.","Kerala govt orders closure of school for communal curriculum","789734799","2018-01-08","http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-orders-closure-of-school-for-communal-curriculum/story-Pwla0zex6GmukKn7QDIbBN.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"5233","","KOCHI: The department of general education has sent a letter to the director of public information (DPI), directing the latter to shut down the Peace International School, which was caught in controversy.

The directive was issued since the department found that it was necessary to ""prevent Muslims from joining IS activities.""

The educational institution, with classes up to middle-school, grabbed the government's attention after the district educational officer complained against the school for teaching objectionable content.

The letter said preliminary inquiries revealed that the textbooks being used at schools were ""aimed towards the propagation of ideas contradicting the secular policies of the country.""

Ernakulam's Peace International School's primary class students were taught lines like, ""He (Allah) is not one of a group of gods and goddesses who fall in love, marry and plot against each other or put silly curses on humans.""

The controversial books, highlighted the benefits of being a Muslim. The books said ""how we (Muslims) should never give up in any matter,"" stating that Allah is one and unique and there can't be any comparison in this case. The children's book even says that ""all other faiths violate this simple command, either explicitly or implicitly.""

The letter said the government had not issued an NoC to the school and it has no CBSE affiliation. The DPI has been requested to take immediate action under the RTE Act to close Peace International School, Kochi, and transfer the students to nearby schools.

""In order to prevent the Muslims from joining IS activities, it is highly necessary to stop the operation of such institutions,"" said the letter from A Shahjahan, secretary, department of general education.

Among the seized books there were those which referred to other religions.

""A lot of people worship objects that can neither harm them nor bring any good,"" an activity for the students was titled in the book.

The Hyderabad district education officer (DEO) conducted a probe on behalf of the collector and found that the school was levying excess fees under various heads without seeking ""approval of DFRC (district fee regulatory committee) regarding the fee structure."" ""The management of Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, is collecting ?100 as application fee and ?500 as registration fee at the time of admission, in addition to the school fee, which clearly shows that the management is collecting high fees from the parents in violation of rules and regulations laid down in GO Ms 1 and GO Ms 91,"" read the enquiry report submitted to the NCPCR earlier this month.

The report stated that the ""defensible explanation"" sought from the school management by the DEO was ""not satisfactory"".

"5245","","BENGALURU: Unable to pay his children's school fees, a 42-year-old employee of a marketing company committed suicide by jumping from the fourth floor of a residential building at Bharathinagar on Friday.

The deceased is Syed Shamim, a resident of HBR Layout in Hennur who was working as a computer operator in a private company in Ulsoor. He married Kathija a few years ago and the couple have two daughters.

Police said the incident took place early morning when Shamim had come to the office located in an apartment premise on MM Lane. He jumped from the fourth floor. The security guards rushed him to a nearby private hospital where he was declared brought dead.

Preliminary investigations revealed that Shamim had not been going to work for several years and his relatives were paying the school fees of his daughters. Upset over this, Kathija forced him to join work. He recently joined a company as a computer operator and he is said to have discussed with his relatives that he could not handle the pressure of family and financing his daughters' education. This led him to take this extreme step, police said.","Man ends life over non-payment of children's school fees","952688886","2018-09-23","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/sep/23/man-ends-life-over-non-payment-of-childrens-school-fees-1875962.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"5247","","MUMBAI: As petrol and diesel rates continued to soar on Monday after reaching a record high a day earlier, school bus operators indicated there could be a hike in bus fees from the second semester in October. The increase could be by around Rs 100 a month per student.

The price of petrol on Monday was Rs 86.56 per litre while diesel was Rs 75.54 per litre in Mumbai. Sources informed TOI that on Tuesday morning, the price of petrol will reach Rs 86.72 per litre and diesel Rs 75.74 per litre.

Anil Garg of the School Bus Owners' Association told TOI that in view of escalating fuel prices, the association will write to all schools on Tuesday, informing them about the need for hiking bus fees. ""We are also facing a lot of problems plying buses on potholed roads in Mumbai. Due to this, there is fuel wastage. This adds to operational costs,"" he said. There are 8,000 school buses that ply on diesel in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which includes Greater Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan, Panvel and Vasai-Virar.

Rising fuel prices may also compel travel agents to increase rates by 10% for private cars/buses hired for picnics and weddings, sources said. As for private tourist buses operating on inter-city routes, there is already a government order restricting them to charge only up to 50% more than MSRTC fares. An official from MSRTC said on Monday that there were no immediate plans to hike state bus fares.

The price of petrol rose by 31 paise and diesel by 42 paise on Monday. Oil company officials said price rise over two weeks has been mainly due to fluctuations in the rates of international crude and a further weakening of the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar.

In Maharashtra, the price of petrol was highest in Nanded (Rs 88.05 per litre on Monday) and this was due to tax, mainly VAT, components, which are higher there. Mumbai continues to have the highest rate for petrol among all metro cities, sources in the oil industry said.","Record diesel prices likely to push up school bus fees in Mumbai - Times of India","938476654","2018-09-03","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/record-diesel-prices-likely-to-push-up-school-bus-fees-in-mumbai/articleshow/65663625.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"5249","","MUMBAI: Individual parents cannot challenge a school fee hike before the divisional fee regulatory committee (DFRC), the Bombay high court has ruled. A division bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre dismissed a petition seeking a change in the law so that a parent aggrieved by a fee hike in a school can approach the regulator.

The Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act (MEIA) gives only the management or the executive committee comprising teachers and PTA representatives to challenge a fee hike order before the DFRC or the revision committee.

The court was hearing a petition filed by parents of a school in Khed, which had hiked fees by 25% for 2016-2017.

""We do not find that the law is one-sided or that there is a frustration of its object and purpose totally if parents do not have the right of appeal as guaranteed to the management,"" said the high court bench.

""Parents definitely have a stake, but they are given that legal status, respect and regard by placing them in the executive committee itself. The law is in that sense progressive for it entrusts the executive committee with important functions and directs them to be performed coupled with the duties to be discharged, which ordinarily could not have been discharged by these stakeholders. In several such laws, the stakeholders and the real ones, namely, students and parents, were excluded and kept out. In the present law, they are not excluded,"" the judges said.

Under the MEIA, the state has powers to regulate the fees of government and aided schools. In the case of private unaided educational institutions, the management has to place the proposed fee hike before the executive committee. The panel is headed by the school principal and comprises representatives of parents and teachers. If the difference between the fees proposed by the management and that approved by the executive committee is less than 15%, the amount finalised by the panel prevails. The management can file an appeal before the DFRC. Both the management and executive committee can file a challenge to the DFRC's decision before the revision committee headed by a retired HC judge.

The petition contended that the law was unconstitutional as it discriminated against parents, who did not have the right to challenge a school fee hike before the regulator. The court said that parents were included in the executive committee and had a say on the issue. ""The aggrieved parents, who are part and parcel of the executive committee, can definitely appeal in the event the management's proposed fees are upheld by the DFRC,"" said the court. ""When the executive committee fails to discharge its statutory duty and function, then it can hardly complain.""","Individual parents can't challenge hike in school fees: Bombay high court - Times of India","929807774","2018-08-22","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/individual-parents-cant-challenge-hike-in-school-fees-bombay-high-court/articleshow/65496852.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"5250","","According to the document, parents will also have to pay 'late fees with interest', if they fail to adhere to the deadline given by schools to pay fees.(REPRESENTATIONAL PICTURE)

Hiking school fees may become easier and representation of parents in the executive committee of the parents-teachers association (PTA) may reduce if the government passes the amendments proposed to the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011.

Parents claim many of the amendments in the 11-page proposal, a copy of which is with HT, favour school managements. One such point is the right given to private school managements to hike fees, either through the approval of a PTA executive committee or by a simple majority of 76% of parents of school students, not necessarily from the committee, under ""unforeseen"" circumstances. Currently, the sanction of the executive committee is mandatory to impose a hike.

The document also suggests an amendment to the structure of the PTA's executive committee by reducing the number of joint secretaries from two to one, reducing the number of parents in it.

While the document is not out in the public domain, a member of the committee that drafted it confirmed the proposed changes. A government official, who is in the know of the issue, said deliberations over the proposed amendments were on and it has not been finalised.

Among the other amendments is the nod to allow schools to ask parents to pay fees on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis. According to the document, parents will also have to pay 'late fees with interest', if they fail to adhere to the deadline given by schools to pay fees.

Parents are unhappy with the changes. ""The government is just trying to shield the interests of private managements by bringing in such amendments. If passed, all parents will oppose it,"" said Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents' Association.

In December 2017, an 11-member committee headed by retired HC judge VD Palshikar recommended that parents and PTAs should have more rights to handle fee-related disputes. Taking it into account, state education minister Vinod Tawde had said the government would work towards amending the Act in the following few months. The committee's recommendations did not include some of the contentious amendments present in this document. Despite repeated attempts, Tawde did not respond to the messages.

The city sessions court permitted the prisoner to visit a relative's house between 10 am and 5 pm on Sunday under police escort at the state's expenditure so that he could arrange for fees.

The case involved inmate Narendrasingh Jadon, who was arrested last year in connection with a murder in Amraiwadi.

He has said that since he was lodged in jail and there was no other earning member in his family who could make such arrangements.

"5263","","AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government on Tuesday issued a government resolution listing out activities for which the schools cannot compulsorily charge as part of the fee package.

The list of activities include transportation, hostel, lodging, food facility, excursions or field trips, horse-riding, swimming, club activities, books, stationary and co-curricular activities not part of the concerned board's syllabus.

The state government has stated that it has the rights to further amend this list as and when required.

""We have declared the list for which fee is optional and schools cannot mandate the parents to pay for the same,"" said education minister Bhupendra Chudasama. The GR also stated that schools that have not submitted their fee proposal before the Fee Regulation Committee (FRC) should do the same before July 31.

The state government was directed to compile the list of non-curricular activities by the Supreme Court on July 11 as it ruled that charges for non-academic activities cannot be thrust upon students by private schools.

The court had said that fee charged for such activities cannot be charged as part of the fee package. The court observations came during a hearing of the dispute between the Federation of Self Financed Schools and the Gujarat government over the state's new law, the Gujarat Self Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017 which was enacted last year ahead of the state assembly polls. Its stated aim is to regulate exorbitant fee charged by private schools and thus reduce the financial burden on parents.

Private schools challenged the constitutional validity of Gujarat's fee regulation law in the SC. The state government had insisted last week that private schools can't force students to pay for activities that are strictly not related to education or the syllabus.

The NCPCR has recommended to the states a slew of measures like use of artificial intelligence and digital technology for regulation of school fees amid rising complaints of inappropriate fee hike against private and unaided schools. It has also suggested that states should form a committee in every district for such regulation, according to a child rights body official.

The fees of schools should be fixed using a suitable mechanism by use of digital technology and artificial intelligence, said Priyank Kanoongo, member (RTE & Education) at the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).

The committees would be headed by district collector or district magistrate as chairperson and the fees should be determined for each school, he said, adding the panel would recommended a 10 per cent yearly cap on an increase of fees.

The NCPCR has sent its recommendations to the HRD Ministry. It also suggested formation of a parent-teacher association (PTA) who would participate in the fees determination of schools. The PTA shall consist of one parent representative from each class such that three-fourth of members of such committee shall be parents or guardians, Kanoongo said.

According to the framework, after submission, ""the proposal will be analysed taking into consideration the variable indicators of expenditure and income (as given by the school in enclosed performas/forms/annexures including depreciation/loans/interests etc.) and constant indicators of the respective district using software/ artificial intelligence"".

The committees would be formed under a framework developed by the child rights body.

The model framework is for private unaided schools which are 23 per cent of the total schools in India catering to 36 per cent of total population of children attending school.

The schools will submit a proposal for fee determination and those which fail to come out with proposals in the stipulated time period would be slapped with a fine of up to 10 per cent of the total revenue generated by them in the preceding year, Kanoongo said.

According to him, the decision to introduce a framework was taken to provide a preventive strategy against physical, mental and emotional harassment of children in schools resulting from mutual dispute between school and parents on fees related issue, he said.

Kanya Gupta, mother of a 12-year-old boy, said the inappropriate fees hike by private and unaided schools has been long bothering them.

""I have other younger children and I can't be spending all the money on education of one. We have been contemplating of switching to a government school following the recent fee hike of 15 per cent,"" she said without disclosing the name of the school.

Another parent Subhash Kumar said he has put his 10-year-old daughter in another school following the fees hike. ""I would prefer sending my daughter for extra tuition than paying such high fees inappropriately,"" he said.

Last week, the Directorate of Education took stern action against the Bal Bharti School in Delhi for hiking its fees by 10 per cent for the academic session 2017-18, over the previous academic session 2016-17 in the name of implementation of 7th pay commission.

Based on review of the audited financial statement, the Directorate observed that school purchased a luxury car amounting to Rs. 19.77 lakh during the financial year 2014-15 reportedly out of school funds.

"5266","","The NCPCR has recommended to the states a slew of measures like use of artificial intelligence and digital technology for regulation of school fees amid rising complaints of inappropriate fee hike against private and unaided schools. It has also suggested that states should form a committee in every district for such regulation, according to a child rights body official.

The fees of schools should be fixed using a suitable mechanism by use of digital technology and artificial intelligence, said Priyank Kanoongo, member (RTE & Education) at the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). The committees would be headed by district collector or district magistrate as chairperson and the fees should be determined for each school, he said, adding the panel would recommended a 10 per cent yearly cap on increase of fees.

The NCPCR has sent its recommendations to the HRD Ministry. It also suggested formation of a parent-teacher association (PTA) who would participate in the fees determination of schools. The PTA shall consist of one parent representative from each class such that three-fourth of members of such committee shall be parents or guardians, Kanoongo said.

The apex body for child rights, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has prepared guidelines for regulating admission fee levied by private unaided schools. The Commission has also recommended setting up a district-level body which will consult parents and teachers while determining school fee on a case-by-case basis.

""We have submitted the model framework to the Secretary of Human Resource Development Ministry and requested her to ask States to either adopt the guidelines or incorporate our suggestions to their own framework.

Mr Kanoongo said the NCPCR took suo motu cognisance of the problem of exorbitant school fees after it received several complaints on the matter. He added that the Commission has studied regulations framed by various States over a period of six months and has included best practices in its model framework. The guidelines recommend setting up a District Fee Regulatory Committee (DFRC) in each district. The body will be headed by the Collector or District Magistrate.

For three years

As per the procedure laid down by the NCPCR, every school will have to submit its fee proposal online by October 31 for the next academic session, following which an algorithm will calculate the minimum and maximum fee a school can charge. This would be then analysed by the DFRC, which will consult representatives from the school as well as its Parent-Teacher Association before arriving at the final decision. The fee finalised thus will be applicable for three academic years.

If a school fails to submit its proposal, it may face a ban on new admissions for the entire academic session or withdrawal of its formal recognition. If a school is not satisfied with the DFRC decision, it can appeal to the State Appellate Authority whose decision will be final.","NCPCR moots model for school fees","905606353","2018-07-14","https://www.thehindu.com/education/schools/ncpcr-moots-model-for-school-fees/article24421372.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

"5269","","NEW DELHI: Alina Azam, a five-year old student of Hauz Kazi's Rabea Girl's Public School, has not gone to school for three days now. Being locked up in the school basement a few days ago has traumatised her, the girl's father, Azam Ali, insists. There were 30 others with her, most of them kindergarten students, who were allegedly detained in the basement activity room for over four hours because they had not paid the school fees. The uproar over the lengthy confinement forced chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia and area MLA Imran Hussain to visit the school on Thursday.

Irate parents took the opportunity to narrate their tales to the political leaders. On July 9 Mohammad Zulfiqar, who sells shoes at Old Delhi's Meena Bazaar, reached the school in the afternoon, as he normally did, to pick up his daughter. When he did not find her in her classroom, he was told by a teacher that ""she is in the basement room"". Zulfiqar is incensed that the school claimed he hadn't paid the girl's fees and said it should have enquired from the bank. ""My daughter asked me the following day if she would again be kept in the basement!"" the man muttered.

The CM and others had short discussions with the school principal and the parents. Sisodia later said that he had ""warned the principal"", and added that he has asked the deputy education director to prepare a factsheet on the issue and determine who was responsible for the children's discomfort. Police have already filed an FIR in the case.

There was, however, some support for the authorities of 44-year-old school on Thursday. Shamaila Jaffery, an engineer and alumnus, blamed the local media for hyping up the story. ""I am appalled to see the name of my school sullied,"" Jaffery said. ""Some people created a false narrative about the whole incident.""

Sania, mother of one of the children kept in the activity room, admitted that she thought it was odd to find her daughter in the basement and not in the classroom, but reasoned, ""The children were not locked in the room. They were allowed to go out for recess and to the toilet. In fact, my daughter was baffled to see other children crying around her. She was fine.""","Delhi CM visits school that 'detained' kids over fees - Times of India","904709323","2018-07-13","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cm-visits-school-that-detained-kids-over-fees/articleshow/64967538.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"5270","","NEW DELHI:THE National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has approved the first-ever national guidelines on regulating fee in private schools that prescribe penal provision for those institutions that violate the norms.

The guidelines titled Model Fee Regulatory Mechanism are the result of a project supported by the Union HRD ministry. The framework prescribes a two-level process to decide fee in a particular school in any district every three years and it relies on technology.

According to the guidelines, fee in any school will depend on fixed and variable factors such as per capita income of a districts, inflation, depreciation, city allowances and facilities offered by a particular school.

""We are asking states to adopt a software factoring in all the inputs-constant and variable components-which will then tell them what fee will be appropriate for a particular class in a particular school,"" Priyank Kanoongo, NCPCR member (education) who has overseen the drafting of the guidelines, told The New Indian Express.

After the fee is thus decided, the school management will take it up with the Parent Teachers Association, which will have at least 25 per cent representation from parents of students belonging to economically weaker sections.

Other members in the PTA will represent parents of other classes and will be chosen through draws.Once decisions on fee for all classes are made, the proposal will be taken up with the district level regulatory committee, whose decision will be final, but the school management can take it to state appellate authority.

Schools not following guidelines will be docked part of revenue

Once decisions on fees for all classes are taken, the proposal will be taken up with the district-level regulatory committee headed by the district magistrate. It will have the district transport officer, district accounts officer and district teachers training officer as the other members.The state appellate authority, which school managements can approach if they are not happy with the district panel's decision, will have representation of secretaries of relevant departments.

If the school management wants to revise the fee before three years, it will need the approval of the state-level authority.The guidelines, which will now be required to be adopted by states, also say that schools that don't follow the norms will be penalised at 1 per cent of the annual revenue generated for the first violation, 2 per cent of revenue in case of a second violation and 3 per cent of the revenue in the event of a third violation.

Schools can be further penalised by being put in the ""no admission"" list by the district committee.There are currently no such guidelines for regulating school fees in most states, but in Madhya Pradesh the state government has adopted a technology-led process to decide the fees in some technical higher education institutes.Kanoongo said the need for coming up with such guidelines was felt due to thousands of complaints pouring in from aggrieved parents across the country.

"5274","","AHMEDABAD: In a major breather to parents, the Supreme Court of India on Wednesday ruled that charges for non-academic activities cannot be thrust upon students by private schools. The court ordered the Gujarat government to list activities undertaken by private schools for which payment is optional for students.

The apex court said that fees towards transportation, sports and other activities that do not form part of students' studies are strictly optional and cannot be a mandatory part of the fee package.

The court observations came during a hearing of the dispute between the Federation of Self Financed Schools and the Gujarat government over the state's new law, the Gujarat Self Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017 which was enacted last year ahead of the state assembly polls. Its stated aim is to regulate exorbitant fee charged by private schools and thus reduce the financial burden on parents.

Private schools challenged the constitutional validity of Gujarat's fee regulation law in the SC. At an April hearing of this case, the court told the state government not to question the decisions of schools to offer non-curricular activities to improve education standards, effectively pushing them out of the ambit of the fee structure to be fixed by the fee regulatory committee (FRC).

As this discussion was went forward, the state government on Tuesday insisted that private schools can't force students to pay for activities that are strictly not related to education or the syllabus. The apex court accepted this submission, said government pleader Manisha Shah.

Besides, the apex court has also directed 1,863 private schools to submit their proposals for regulated fees to FRCs in a week. Of more than 15,700 private schools in the state, 1,863 schools have not yet approached the authorities to finalize their fee structures, for various reasons.","SC knocks off extras from Gujarat school fees - Times of India","903941349","2018-07-12","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/sc-knocks-off-extras-from-gujarat-school-fees/articleshow/64953623.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

In fact, a news channel even showed some children crying in the ""basement"" where they were allegedly locked up.

However, the principal has denied the allegations that the school children werepunished.

""The basement is not a punishment place; it is an activity room where children play and learn music. It is a kind of classroom,"" said the principal, reported HT.

A teacher at the school said that the confusion must have stemmed from the fact that a teacher's slip, which is usually attached to the fee slip might not have been handed over to the teachers.

""There was confusion over fee submission as the school was not informed by the school administration. It will be clarified with the accounts section. Some parents have not submitted a 'teacher copy' to the school and it created the confusion,"" said the teacher.

"5297","","NEW DELHI: In an online survey, 50 per cent of the parents surveyed said that they had accommodated excessive school fees by cutting discretionary spending. Rising school fees are a common phenomenon in the country, with 83 per cent parents saying that their children's school fees had been hiked recently.

The survey was conducted by online community platform Local Circles in more than 220 districts, and over 30,000 people participated.

The survey asked parents how they had accommodated school fee increases in recent years. Twenty-six per cent said they had reduced their investments, 50 per cent said they had cut discretionary spending such as on travel, shopping etc., while 24 per cent said they had cut back on home and vehicle upgrades.

The second issue was the way to regulate school fees. Should school fees be capped, as has been done in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, where schools cannot charge above a certain amount?

Forty-six per cent of the respondents said that school fee hikes should be linked to inflation, and not be arbitrary. Around 36 per cent wanted a cap on the total fee amount, while 18 per cent wanted to cap the annual fee hike percentage.

The majority wanted regulation to focus on annual fee hikes and not the absolute fee.","Families cut travel, shopping to pay school fees","900892075","2018-07-06","http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/jul/07/families-cut-travel-shopping-to-pay-school-fees-1839530.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

""Schools adopt various ways to hike the total fees. While the tuition fee may not be hiked, all other fees like annual/admission fee are raised indiscriminately by the schools. Hence, when asked whether this fee, under the head of annual or admission fee, should be limited to one month of tuition fee, 93 per cent of the citizens agreed,"" the survey by LocalCircles revealed.

For the survey, the LocalCircles community social media platform received over 58,000 responses from over 21,000 parents in 215 districts in the country.

The survey also focused on the ways to regulate school fee hikes, with the majority of parents (54 per cent of 13,317 votes) feeling that the percentage of hike should be linked to inflation.

One of the biggest arguments given by schools for raising fees is to enhance the quality of education or maintain it but in the polls, parents do not seem to be convinced of this line.

Almost 77 per cent of 7,205 parents say that capping of fees would not affect the quality of education.

As many as 30 children are struggling to get admission in school because of the vindictive actions of D S Desai school in Kalyan, after a tussle with their parents over recent fee hikes. The students were kicked out of school in March and were Leaving Certificates (LC) with negative remarks, ensuring that no other school was willing to give them admission.

After the students and their parents staged a protest at the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) education department yesterday, the civic authorities have now formed a team to probe the matter.

One of the parents Sakina Shaikh said, ""We have been fighting against the illegal fee hike for a long time. Our children are suffering even though they are innocent. They were given LC because we did not pay the fee hike.""

She added, ""The school kept increasing the fees for two consecutive years, which is against the rules. We opposed this move, but the school did not respond, so we stopped paying the fees. Then the school just gave our kids LCs, which state that we have not paid the fees. Because of this, it has become difficult for our children to seek admission elsewhere.""

According to the parents, the they were paying Rs 12,000 per month in 2016-17, which was hiked to R15,000 in 2017-18, and has now inflated to R20,000. This is an over 66 per cent hike in two years. JJ Tadvi, education officer at KDMC, said, ""We have received several complaints from parents about the fee hike.

Their father alleged that he was willing to pay the amount, but the school refused to accept it. He now says that the institution was being unjust to his children.

Mehrban Singh claimed that he had paid the fee for three months, but was later told that the school took it as an outstanding amount and failed to inform him about the next payment. Without clearing the issue, the school also went ahead to send leaving certificates of a boy and girl to their home. The leaving certificates reached him on June 7, after which he approached the deputy director of education (DyDE). Subsequently, the regional education officer was instructed to investigate the issue. Also, the school was told, through a letter, to not remove the students. Despite this, on June 21 commemorated as Yoga Day, the school sent the kids home.

Singh's kids study in Class II and Class III. Talking to Mirror,the father said, ""I paid the fees for the next three months at the start of the academic year. The school considered it as the outstanding amount and sent a leaving certificate of my children through speed post. When I approached the school, I was told to pay a fee of Rs 18,000. I was willing to pay, but the school had informed the Thane Janata Sahakari Bank, where we usually deposit the amount, to not accept the fees. After the leaving certificate was issued on June 7, the DyDE sent a letter on June 14 to the school, asking not to remove the students. But still, my kids were later sent home.""

Talking about the issue, DyDE Meenakshi Raut said, ""After the parent approached me, I asked the regional education officer to look into the matter. No school is authorised to remove students due to non-payment of fees. At most, the school can charge for paying late or inform parents to pay the amount at the earliest. Removing students from school is clearly against the Right to Education (RTE) norms.""

Singh further said that since most schools have already started the academic year, it has become impossible for him to find another institution for his kids. He said, ""My kids are also scared now after they were sent leaving certificates and removed from the premises. The school should consider if a parent is unable to pay fees. In my case, I was willing to clear the pending amount, but was not given a chance.""

When Mirror contacted Savita Utekar, the principal, she informed through an SMS that the management will take a final decision regarding the students after conducting a meeting.","School sends siblings home due to non-payment of fees - Pune Mirror - ","892928594","2018-06-24","https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/pune/others/school-sends-siblings-home-due-to-non-payment-of-fees/articleshow/64715101.cms","Pune Mirror",FALSE
"5301","","The Thane anti-extortion cell has arrested a garage mechanic who allegedly stole seven cars, changed their chassis number and engine number and sold them to customers at market value. Police said the accused had done so in order to pay the school fees of his six children.

The accused, Inayat Rehmatulla Shah,31, is a resident of Ghatkopar area.

Police said Shah used to buy cars damaged in accident that are auctioned by insurance companies. After the purchase, he would get original registration papers for the car. Shah would then steal a car of the same model and colour. He would then replace the stolen car's number plate, chassis number and engine number with those of the car he had just purchased. Shah would then sell off the car at market price to customers.

""He had stolen seven cars from Thane, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai. We have recovered seven cars, which are valued at ₹40 lakh combined,"" said Pradeep Sharma, senior police inspector from Thane anti-extortion cell.

Police said Shah had resorted to crime as he was unable to pay the school fees of his six children. When he tried to borrow money from family and friends, he had failed. Police said that following the advice of his friend Arjun Kumar, Shah decided upon stealing cars and selling them. Police are on the lookout for Kumar.

The parents of the students have stated that the school management was overcharging them.

""We paid Rs 30,000 fee and Rs 10,000 as a deposit earlier and asked them to adjust the deposit in the fee but the school is not ready to talk to us,"" said a parent.

Queen Mary's School at Model Town-III was instructed by the AAP government to roll back the hike after parents had complained to Cheif Minister Arvind Kejriwal about the arbitrary fee hike in the school for the session 2018-19.

During a public interaction programme last week, Kejriwal has said, ""Our government immediately took note of the complaints. It considered the fee hike to be in violation of the judgments of the honorable Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court and also the directions of the Education Department,"" said a statement released by the Delhi government.

In a blow to parents who have been protesting fee hike by schools, the Bombay High Court has said school managements ""always"" have the liberty to cancel the admission of students in case of non-payment of fees. The High Court passed the order in a civil application by the city-based Zeal Education Society's Dnyanganga English Medium School versus parents who had refused to pay the increased fees. Until now, parents who had fought against fee hike by schools believed that their children couldn't be expelled as, they argue, the Right to Education (RTE) Act prohibited any such action.

The HC order, however, stated that in case students didn't pay the fees, school managements ""always"" have the right to cancel the admission. The tussle between the Dnyanganga English Medium School management and parents of students has been going on for a long time. In 2015, some of the parents had approached the District Fee Regulatory Committee (DFRC) against the fee hike by the school.

Last year, DFRC termed the fee hike illegal and asked the school to refund the hiked amount to parents. The school management then approached the Bombay High Court and asked it to direct parents to pay the fees. However, the High Court has said that asking parents to pay the school fees was beyond its jurisdiction and it can't compel any parent to pay fees fixed by the applicant (school management). The court also observed that the school management has said the fee hike was introduced before the rules under the Fee Regulation Act came into effect, and the fees determined by school would not be covered by the Act.

The High Court has also given a stay on the DFRC order that had found the fee hike 'illegal'. ""If parents refuse to pay fees as determined by the applicant, which at the relevant time did not come under the purview of the act, the management cannot be expected to run the school without there being the requisite funds,"" observed the HC bench.

The school management has welcomed the order. Jayesh Katkar, executive director of Zeal Education Society, said, ""... Today, nearly one-third of 1,500-odd parents are refusing to pay... parents who are paying fees should not be made to bear the brunt of those not paying the fees. Now, we will send a request to clear all dues until 2017-2018 within seven days, so that we do not have to take any drastic steps..."" he said. Vinod Dharekar, one of the protesting parents who is also an advocate, said the parents were yet to take a decision on their next step. ""We did not expect this order and we will hold a meeting to discuss it,"" he said.

"5309","","Coimbatore: A day after the admission process started in government schools, some parents returned from the government higher secondary school at Kinathukadavu without enrolling their children as they could not pay the school fees.

""When my daily wage is only about Rs 300, how can I manage to pay Rs 400 at short notice,"" asked Subramani (name changed), the parent of a Class VI student, who postponed enrolling his child.

He said most parents were not aware that government schools too charge fees, and added that he would try to arrange the amount in a few days.

The school charged Rs 200 from students who enrolled in Tamil medium, and Rs 400 from students who opted for English medium. The fee includes Rs 50 as fund for Parents Teachers Association (PTA) and Rs 150 as maintenance fees.

The school administration gives receipts for Rs 50 and Rs 150 separately but does not provide one for the Rs 200 they collect for English medium students, said parents.

Most of the residents at Kinathukadavu are daily wage labourers and their wage is not more than Rs 400 per day, said Siva Guru, a local resident whose neighbours postponed enrolling their children in schools as they had to save the fee amount.

""When the school did not give the option of paying the fees later, doesn't it mean the fee is mandatory and we have to pay immediately,"" asked Subramani. He said they did not want to escalate the issue as the school is the only option for their children to get education.

Citing that there is only one school in the Kinathukedavu region, P Mani, another resident, said the other options were the government school at Vadasithur, which is 7km away, and the government school at Kovilpalayam, 10km away.

Headmistress of the school Parvathi said parents could pay the fee later on if they are not able to pay immediately.

""We have fixed the maintenance fund as Rs 150 only after discussing it with members of the PTA,"" she said and explained that the school authorities had appointed a sweeper, a scavenger and a clerk with the PTA fund.

She said the school had to pay Rs 200 per student enrolled in English medium to the school education department. Instead of collecting it in the middle of the year, they chose to collect it during admission time.

Chief education officer (CEO) P Ayyannan agreed that the sum had to be collected for enrolling students in English medium, but he had not issued any circular to collect the fee immediately.

""The issue had not been brought to my notice. I will enquire into it,"" he added.","Not able to pay govt school fees, daily wagers put off enrolling children - Times of India","861729064","2018-05-03","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/not-able-to-pay-govt-school-fees-daily-wagers-put-off-enrolling-children/articleshow/64021758.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"5310","","A private school has submitted with the police more than Rs 1 lakh that a parent had submitted as fee for his three children after coming to know that the money was part of Rs 25 lakh looted from an ATM kiosk.

Two bike-borne youth had on April 7 looted Rs 25 lakh from a security van, which was supplying cash to replenish an ATM of a private bank in Roorkee. The robbers had also allegedly shot at and injured the company's security guard, Shakeel Ahme

"5311","","While people mostly think of payments and wallets when we hear the word fintech, credit has been growing in importance as well. Data that's available online can help companies - particularly payments companies that already have a trove of user data - to make more informed decisions about loans, and issue credit in real time. It's been on the roadmap for companies like Paytm for long, and others like MoneyTap have been able to offer a line of credit up to Rs. 5 lakh - although the social indicators that it relies on still lead it to rejecting the majority of applicants.

At the other end of the spectrum, microcredit is gaining ground in the form of buy-now pay-later companies, like Simpl, or LazyPay, that give you credit in just a few thousands, to buy things online, pay for cabs, or order food. LazyPay is owned by PayU, which started as as one of the many wallets in India, but went on to become one of the bigger payment gateways here.

Last month, PayU launched a new service that falls at the other end of the spectrum, called Monedo, which offers loans from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 100,000. One of the sectors where this has been very successful is education, where PayU Monedo has tied up with Byjus, Meritnation, Amity, and many other online and offline institutions. ""It's an EMI solution,"" explains Shailaz Nag, MD, PayU, ""If a customer comes to the website, he should get EMI on the fly, real time credit. It is available to people at the right time, at the right place, via PayU's distribution network.""

You could be shopping on an e-commerce website, trying to book your holiday travel plans, or paying your fees for tuitions via a service like Byjus, and PayU could offer to convert the bill into an EMI on the stop.

The goal is to target people who are served by banks but don't use credit cards, because India is ""debit card country,"" says Nag. ""Credit card penetration is very low, there are only around 30 million credit cards and over 800 million debit cards. So the banking population who can make use of EMIs in India is very low.""

Aside from that, many people with credit cards also don't want to use them to take EMIs, adds Gurjodhpal Singh, Senior Vice President and Business Head, PayU Monedo. ""Before launching [Monedo] we did customer research, and what we found is that the credit card limit for people is also quite low,"" he adds. ""People who are using the cards tend to use them for the household monthly expenses also, and if you take an EMI, then a big portion of your limit gets blocked on the card. So even consumers with a credit card are looking for other EMI options.""

The actual product is quite straightforward. If you choose the EMI option, then you'll have to enter a few details (and it could just be your Aadhaar number, depending on what you're spending on - more on that in a bit) and then get started, with a minimal four to five clicks according to Nag. The way it works is a little more complex.

Like LazyPay and the microcredit platforms we've talked about earlier, there's a lot of data about the user that's being collected here, and that might make people a little uneasy. PayU has tried to integrate this service with the different sites it's available on, and it uses the data that these sites can provide in order to work out how much of a risk you are, and what kind of rates and repayment periods it can offer you.

This data is also used to populate as much of the forms as possible, which is why Onboarding could require as little as your Aadhaar number and an OTP confirmation. And of course, PayU itself has a rich store of data on users which it can run through its algorithms as well.

Interestingly, in the month and a half that it's been running, the numbers are looking good for PayU Monedo, according to Nag. The loans range from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 100,000, with the largest loan approved so far being for Rs. 92,000. In the last month and a half, it has disbursed over 800 loans, amounting to Rs. 2.5 crore, with the average loan being roughly Rs. 30,000, and while the company didn't share the repayment figures, Nag says it's done well. ""Repayment has been very good, and we're using machine learning to improve our performance, and to target better customers,"" adds Singh.

Nag is able to offer one more statistic which shows the importance your data holds for fintech companies. According to Nag, the acceptance rate for customers - on sites where PayU is getting data from the site - is 85 - 90 percent. On the other hand, on sites where PayU is not so deeply integrated, the acceptance rate plummets to just about 15 percent, he says.

And what do people use this for? There are two main uses, according to Nag. The first is education, as parents need to make hefty payments upfront, which can be onerous. But the other category, that's almost as popular? ""Buying mobile phones,"" says Nag.","From Mobiles to School Fees - How People are Using PayU's EMI Platform","859597292","2018-04-30","https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/features/payus-new-emi-platform-monedo-is-proving-to-be-popular-when-paying-fees-and-buying-mobiles-1844996","NDTV Gadgets360.com",FALSE
"5312","","AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government's new law for regulation of fees in private schools ahead of 2017 assembly elections seems another futile effort in a long list of attempts made by the administration for more than 150 years in the region of Gujarat, from the time it was under Bombay Presidency.

The debate over school fee structure, in fact, had begun 150 years ago. But the unchecked commercialization permitted by successive governments has festered to a new high which the authority finds tough to control. Had the government paid any heed to the golden words spoken one and a half century ago and now lying buried in bulky government records, the situation would have been different.

In 1968, after an inspection of the existing schooling system in the Bombay Presidency, then director of public instruction, J B Peile wrote about fee hike, ""A fair and suitable fee raises the tone of a school; but an excessive fee degrades it, by making it the monopoly of a class.""

In the voluminous 'Report of the Department of Public Instruction in the Bombay Presidency' submitted in 1869-70, the British education officials rued a situation in which reducing fees in vernacular schools could not bring students back to school.

Educational inspector of the northern division (Gujarat), T B Curtis reported, ""The reduction of fee from one rupee to 8 annas, which took place in 1868, did not lead to any increase in pupils, and in all places except the large towns, this fee is still considered to be high by the people.""

He recorded that in 50 schools in different regions of Gujarat, net decrease of students studying English was 143 against an increase of 38 students in classical languages.

The reports of the public instruction department were full of discussion on how to collect fees and to what extent, and how much burden should the government bear.

Peile was of the opinion that at least one third of the cost of education should be borne by the community. But he felt that the fees in Indian schools were higher than those in other countries and advised the government to bring it down.

""Government can compare the scale of fees with those in force in other countries. I believe that the school fees are higher than those in France or Germany. The highest school fee rate in Prussia is £ 4 per annum, and in Switzerland £ 2-8. I hope, therefore, the government will come to conclusion that the public interests are sufficiently cared for in this matter,"" Peile wrote.

The report mentioned that hiring good English teachers required more money and people did not have the capacity to pay high fees. This led the department to take a decision to close English classes in Gujarat ""whenever they contained less than 15 boys paying an 8 anna fee"".

This situation posed a question before the director about the quality of education and he was clear that it is good not to have any teacher than to have a bad teacher. He wrote, ""It is the duty of the government to refuse to supply any but good English teachers, and, if the people cannot subscribe the pay of a good English teacher, to refuse to allow a bad one to teach in a government school.""","Even British tried to tame school fees in Gujarat - Times of India","858919531","2018-04-29","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/even-british-tried-to-tame-school-fees/articleshow/63955946.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"5313","","JAIPUR: Rajasthan High Court has asked Bharatiya Vidhya Bhawan Society and Vidhyashram School to file an affidavit on the fees structure of the school last year and the revised fees along with the annual expenditure incurred for running the school.

The division bench of Justice M N Bhandari and D C Somani issued the direction on a petition challenging the order issued by the district education officer (DEO) Jaipur-I on April 20 staying the fee hike affected by the school management.

The petition challenging the Rajasthan Schools (Regulation of Fee) Act 2016 said, order dated April 20 is beyond the authority of the said officer since no such provision so as to enable such officer to address or direct upon any fee-related grievance has been provided in the Act of 2016. Further, the Act talks about the state regulating the fee collected by private unaided educational institutions, which is violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner to regulate and manage the petitioner school as guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India.

The petition contended that Vidhyashram School is a non-aided autonomous school. So the government cannot control the fee structure determined by the school management.

""The Act and the subsequent order of the district education officer are both irreparably harmful not only to the petitioner but also all the students associated with the petitioner school since if the petitioner school does not collect the fee at revised rates, it will not be able to incur the expenditure that is a result of provision of adequate infrastructure, facilities, appropriate remuneration etc.""

The Supreme Court also in an earlier order had upheld the right of the private schools to charge the fees according to the facilities provided to the students, it was argued.

The school management further contested that the fees committee which determines the fess of the private schools are dominated by government officials and the schools have little say in the decision. The petition said the fee committee is headed by the divisional commissioner and other government officials. Even the representative of the private school is decided by the government, said Prateek Kasliwal, counsel for the petitioner. The matter has been posted for next hearing on May 1.

Court stays government order on banning pass books

Jaipur: The Rajasthan High Court, while staying the order of the director of secondary education banning the use of pass books by students and teachers, issued notice to the director.

The single bench of Justice SP Sharma issued the order on a petition by Sanjiv Prakashan.

Director on March 13 this year issued the order imposing restriction on the use of pass books and instead use textbooks and also warned of disciplinary action against the violators of the order.

"5314","","Parents of students at a school in Dahisar have filed a complaint with the divisional fee regulatory committee, citing that the academic institution has been illegally charging additional fees from students.

The parents said that the school charges each student Rs50,000 as a non-refundable registration fee, which according to the complainant, constitutes as a capitation fee, which has been banned by the state government. An additional Rs3,600 is collected as an admission fee from Class 1 students.

The parents said that they were forced to buy books costing Rs1,350, directly from the school which also made it compulsory for uniforms to be purchased from them, allegedly at a higher price than the market rate. Additionally, parents of students are being made to foot computer fees of Rs2,200 and late payment fees of Rs100, for which no official receipts are issued.

""Last year's Class 1 fee was Rs40,625, whereas, this year the school authorities are demanding Rs56,200 which includes admission fee of Rs3,600. This is a 38% rise compared to last year,"" said one parent.

The complaint states that for the last three years, there has been a 10% fee hike every year, which was not approved by the parent-teacher association (PTA) executive committee. However, the school authorities, in their hearing with the parents, said that they would continue with the 10% hike as the PTA had approved it.

""There have been hearings with state education minister Vinod Tawde, who has also directed the school to lower their fee hike,"" said a senior official from the office of the Deputy Director of School Education.

""We have decided not to vote in the upcoming state assembly elections till education is made affordable for our children,"" said another parent. Alongside an investigation, the parents have demanded a refund of the initial registration fees, based on the prohibition of Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fee) Act 1987.

The school principal was not available for a comment regarding the issue, despite several attempts to get in touch with her.","Dahisar school charging illegal fees of ₹50,000","857627186","2018-04-26","https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dahisar-school-charging-illegal-fees-of-50-000/story-4MirqkhhwNVtGfUfmcUFTN.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Fighting back tears, Divya, his wife, said on Friday, ""He would leave home in the morning, around 9.15am. It was routine for us that he would come back and we would have our lunch together. On Thursday, when he did not return, I kept calling him on his phone, but there was no response. Later, I got a call from a police officer who said my husband felt giddy and was in KEM Hospital.""

When Divya reached the hospital, she learnt the truth. Sangle made around Rs 20,000 a month. Divya works as a maid and makes a tenth of the amount her husband earned. The daughters are yet to come to terms with the fact that their father is no more. ""They keep asking about him,"" said Kishore Malusare, a relative. ""We are now worried about the girls' education.

"5319","","Mumbai: The Bombay High Court recently held that a school does not become a 'good' school only because of its 'high' fees or expenses. The HC further said that no parent can insist on admitting their children into a school which involves high expenses.

The ruling was pronounced by a single-judge bench of Justice Bharati Dangre while hearing a matrimonial dispute. The bench was seized with a plea filed by a mother challenging the orders of the Family Court disallowing her to admit her minor daughter to a school of her choice and instead allowing her husband to get the daughter admitted to a school of his choice.

The mother had shortlisted an international school in Borivali for her daughter while the father had selected a school in Bandra, which was near their residence in Wadala. The school chosen by the mother charged Rs six lakh per year while the one decided on by the father charged only Rs 85,000.

Having heard the submissions canvassed before her, Justice Dangre noted, ""There is a difference of approximately 7 to 8 times in the fees of the school selected by the mother as compared to the school shortlisted by the father."" ""It is no doubt true that the mother can insist on a good schooling for a child, but she cannot insist that it should be a school which involves high expenditure because necessarily, merely because the fees are high, would not make the school a good school,"" Justice Dangre ruled.

Justice Dangre said that a mother's concern that her child should be in a good sch-ool is 'understandable', however, she cannot insist on such an expensive school. During the course of the hearing, the couple with great 'maturity' decided to settle the dispute amicably and shortlist a school near their residence.","Bombay High Court: High fees do not make a school a good one | Free Press Journal","852013568","2018-04-18","http://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/bombay-high-court-high-fees-do-not-make-a-school-a-good-one/1259715","Free Press Journal",FALSE

""Merely because the fees are high, would not make the school a good school,"" the judge added.But the judge left the issue to be decided by the spouses after they agreed to resolve the issue on their own.

Both the spouses had approached the court challenging various orders relating to two adjoining flats in a building at Bhakti Park, Wadala. While the woman wanted an order restraining the husband from entering the two flats jointly purchased by them, the latter sought an order of partitioning the two residences between them.

The family court at Bandra had rejected their pleas and allowed the husband to enter and occupy the houses on the basis that the premises were jointly purchased by the spouses.

The high court upheld this order and directed the woman to co-operate to enable the husband reside in the joint property. The husband has been residing elsewhere after the woman denied him entry into the property and the local police too allegedly refused to interfere in the matrimonial discord.","High fees doesn't mean school is good: HC to warring couple ","851848380","2018-04-17","https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/high-fees-doesn-t-mean-school-is-good-hc-to-warring-couple/story-v4uETu3vB96vM9ViQ5YkiO.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Party's Jaipur district president Pratap Singh Khachariyawas entered the education department office with 100 supporters demanding resignation of education minister Vasudev Devnani for not being able to regulate school fees.

Raising slogans against chief minister Vasundhara Raje and Devnani, Khachariyawas said, ""Every day parents are protesting against the unjust hike of fees up to 30% by the schools but government is yet to react on the issue. They are acting in favour of private schools which will cost them dearly. The issue is serious and will become a big movement in the city.""

Congress has also announced to start a new campaign 'Fees Ghatao, Bachpan Bachao' in all 91 wards on April 18. ""If schools will not roll back the fees in the next 24 hours, Congress will start door-to-door campaign in all 91 wards seeking support of parents and students,"" said Khachariyawas. Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma blamed BJP government for scrapping the state-level fees committee formed during the Gehlot government in 2013. ""They replaced the fees committee by a new Rajasthan Private Fees Act which has a weird provision of 10-member committee including five parents, three teachers and a principal and one member from the school management to decide the fees.

""It is a deliberate attempt by the state to empower schools and allow them to fleece parents,"" said Khachariyawas. The tension between the parents and schools is simmering over fees hike.

"5322","","SHILLONG, April 15: The missionary run schools in the city and state at large have allegedly become ""extremely expensive"" but pragmatic solutions are forthcoming from affected lots in the face of an inept state government. Parents and guardians of the students of these schools have said that missionary/ private run schools hike their fees annually and the state government is found wanting in controlling these institution from their ""looting run"".

The guardians of Loreto Convent (LC) have informed that the school is hiking fees by 10% every year, while brandishing receipts of their wards, and similar responses are also received from their counterparts at All Saints Diocesan Higher Secondary School (ASDHSS), not to forget the other private run schools in the state, including the Pine Mount School.

In LC parents and guardians are alleging that the school is collecting ""uncountable"" fees under ""numerous"" heads and fail to understand why a missionary school has to charge such exorbitant fees. In the latter, they said that the school is charging hefty fees from its students in the name of implementing smart classes. Parents and guardians are fuming, why they have to shed the amount for the smart classes when it is the responsibility of the ASDHSS authorities.

As always, they said that the state government is found mute since there are no regulations, checks and balances from their side. ""Conrad Sangma is talking about work permits to labourers from across the border. Why is he not talking about his predecessor's and his own government's failure to regulate school fees in private and corporate schools,"" said angry parents and guardians of these two prominent schools in the city.

Given the ineptitude of the state government, these parents observed that they have to resort to protest like their counterparts in other parts of the country. One guardian of LC informed that states like Gujarat have a ceiling cap of Rs. 1,250 per month for primary level and Rs. 2,300 for high schools whereas Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab have fee caps besides Uttar Pradesh and Delhi are considering one.

""Why can't Meghalaya have a similar cap? If the government can give permits to mushrooming private schools then why can't the same government control student fees,"" asked exasperated parents.

Meanwhile, interesting solutions are coming forward from informed guardians who observed that no missionary/ private run schools in the state display fees on their websites so that it becomes easier for parents to know before they admit their wards in a school. The prevailing ""hidden"" structure by intending schools is creating much fuss and grudges in the absence of extensive disclosure of the same.","Parents seethe at government ineptitude over school fees","850511892","2018-04-15","http://meghalayatimes.info/index.php/front-page/41952-parents-seethe-at-government-ineptitude-over-school-fees","Meghalaya Times",FALSE

Bal Bharti School in Pitampura, which has hiked its fee citing recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) despite Delhi high court's directions to schools to not increase fee, has also asked parents not to be ""misled by media, social jurists, and activists or anyone else"" since any decline in quality of education and infrastructure will lead to ""loss of learning opportunities for children.""

""The school's revenue has been decreasing on account of a hundred non-fee paying EWS children being admitted each year. Today, the school has over 994 EWS (economically weaker section) children on roll for which the government does not pay a single penny,"" said the circular.

A complaint regarding the circular was also registered with education minister Manish Sisodia and the director of the Directorate of Education (DoE) by education activist Sumit Vohra.

In October last year, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had allowed the schools to hike the fee by 15 per cent to comply with the 7th CPC. However, it withdrew its directions after the high court stayed its order.

Following the order, the government had said it would conduct an audit of the financial accounts of all the 1,700 private schools in the city to stop 'unjustified fee hike.' However, the above school not only hiked the fee, it also asked for six months' tuition fee in advance. The parents have complained that the school has not provided them the breakup of the fee structure yet.

""By asking the parents not to believe the media or activists, the school has attacked the integrity of the press and activists working in the field of education. The parents, who have admitted their wards in the schools, have complained that the school is charging more than it has mentioned on its website and that they have not received any breakup of the fee structure. It cannot hike the fee since it is on government land and the court has currently put a stay on any such increase till further orders,"" said Mr Vohra.","Private school hikes fees to meet fund crunch","850212365","2018-04-15","http://www.asianage.com/metros/delhi/150418/private-school-hikes-fees-to-meet-fund-crunch.html","The Asian Age",FALSE

Indian Institute of Management (IIM), the nation's premier institute for management studies, is all set to hike their course fees this year. Nearly nine IIMs have decided to change their fee structure which is set to see a hike of around 5-17 percent for the 2018-20 batch.

The fee hike is reportedly due to higher operating expenses, faculty pay hikes and the infrastructure costs among other reasons. The top IIMs like Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, and Indore and newer institutes like Rohtak, Ranchi, Trichy, Udaipur and, Amritsar are the nine institutes out of 20 IIMs that are said to be part of the fee-hike, the Economic Times reported.

""Increasing fees is now becoming a compulsion for older and mid-level IIMs such as us. After the first 10 years, IIMs are required to generate their own revenue and sustain themselves through their own corpus. Faculty salaries go up, cost of messes goes up, hospitality costs, security, infrastructure, security goes up, thus necessitating a hike,"" Dheeraj Sharma, IIM Rohtak director, was quoted as saying by ET.

The students will have to shell out an additional Rs 80,000-2 lakh for their Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, depending on the institute. IIM Ahmedabad is set to be the costliest for students as the fees could go upto Rs 22 lakh for a postgraduate degree. IIM Bangalore sees an increase in fees to 21 lakh from 19.5 lakh while IIM Indore fees is set at Rs 16 lakh, ET reported.

Even the newer IIMs have joined the fee-hike bandwagon, as IIM Trichy fees go up to 14 lakhs from 12 lakhs. The institute director of Trichy, B Metri, claimed that the hike in fees is bound to happen due to the consistent quality of education that IIM provides to its students.

""IIMs have consistently been focusing on providing better quality education, many have international accreditations. Factoring in that, plus increasing costs, fees are bound to go up,"" Metri told ET.

Around 87 per cent parents from across the country said that the respective state governments had not been successful in regulating fees. While 61 per cent parents attributed the hike to lack of regulation, 14 per cent said that it was because district officers did not enforce and implement laws with respect to fees effectively.

The committee has reduced fees by up to 36% of the figures proposed by the schools. Only in the case of DAV International, Ahmedabad, has the fee been raised by Rs 542 over what the school had proposed, for the HSC science stream.

The fees declared by the committee for 170-odd schools ranged from Rs 14,000 to Rs 82,500 per annum. However, several prominent schools such as Prakash Higher Secondary, Udgam School for Children, Delhi Public School, and St Kabir have not yet presented fee proposals to the committee.

Sources in the committee said that the fee structure has to be approved by the Supreme court. The next hearing in the Supreme Court is scheduled for April 18. Under the Gujarat Self-financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017, the government had capped annual fees at Rs 15,000 for primary schools, Rs 25,000 for secondary schools, and Rs 27,000 for higher secondary schools barring the science stream. For the science stream, the cap was set at Rs 30,000 per annum.

The government had stated that schools which wanted to charge fees that breached the limit set by the Act had to file an application seeking permission to increase fees. Other schools had to file an affidavit affirming that they were adhering to the caps.

The committee has accepted the proposals of 24 schools and has not changed the fees proposed. Officials said that in the case of the HSC science stream in DAV School, the proposed fee was Rs 44,458; but the committee cleared Rs 45,000.

The officials said that the committee has been consistent in reducing fees across sections. For example, in the case of Red Bricks, Satellite, the proposed fees ranged from Rs 85,600 to Rs 1.18 lakh; the committee fixed the range at Rs 64,200 to Rs 82,500. That's a 25-30% reduction.

Interestingly, many schools had proposed more fees for the secondary sections than for the higher secondary sections. For example, Global Mission International School, Godhavi, proposed Rs 51,820 for the secondary section and Rs 30,000 and Rs 36,000 for the higher secondary general stream and the science stream respectively.","Panel cuts school fees by up to 36% - Times of India","845566958","2018-04-07","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/panel-cuts-school-fees-by-up-to-36/articleshow/63649559.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Is that how an issue of such serious nature has to be dealt with? The principal of the school should be booked under POCSO Act as it's a clear case of exploiting the children's modesty. The children should also be given psychological counselling in the aftermath of such a traumatic experience,"" Rao said.

"5420","","VIJAYAWADA: A video showing six students of a private school in Andhra Pradesh's Chittoor district being paraded naked as a ""punishment"" for being late to school went viral on social media on Thursday.

Authorities at Chaitanya Bharati School forced the students studying in class III and IV to stand naked outside the school after they came in late on Wednesday. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) filed a complaint against the school, following which the district administration lodged a police complaint.

Punganuru sub-inspector P Gouri Shankar said they have booked academic in-charge Dulam Bhuvaneswari and correspondent Kadiyala Nagaraju Naidu for forcing the students to stand outside the school in the sun. ""We received a complaint from Punganuru mandal educational officer (MEO) Pulluru Leelarani on Thursday,"" he said. The accused have been booked under several sections of the IPC, including for causing hurt, assault and criminal intimidation, and section 75 (cruelty) of Juvenile Justice Act.

There are allegations that though the issue was highlighted earlier, the MEO did not initiate any action against the authorities and acted only after Chittoor collector P S Pradyumna ordered an inquiry into it. Chittoor district educational officer, K Panduranga Swamy, has issued orders withdrawing the recognition of the school on Thursday.

'Children must be counselled'

The NCPCR alleged that MEO initially tried to suppress the matter and demanded that his immediate suspension for ""colluding with school management to hush up the issue.""

Child-rights activist Achyuta Rao, who brought the matter to NCPCR, demanded that children be counselled. He also accused police of lapses as they have not invoked Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.","6 kids forced to stand naked for turning up late to school in Andhra Pradesh - Times of India ►","1027939180","2018-12-28","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/6-kids-forced-to-stand-naked-for-turning-up-late-to-school-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/67280714.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"5421","","Vijayawada, December 27: Four students of a private school in Andhra Pradesh were made to strip by the authorities for coming late. The shocking incident was reported in Chittoor, the home district of Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu. The students, whose identities have been withheld, were forced to undergo the torment on Wednesday.

The Chaitanya Bharathi High School, where the students were subjected to the inhumane treatment, is not registered with the government, reports said. Located in Punganur village, it is being administered and owned by a private body. Class 2 Boy in UP's Aligarh Slapped, Punched, Hit With Shoes by Tuition Teacher; Incident Caught on CCTV.

The Andhra Pradesh Balala Hakkula Sangham has raised the matter with the government, and has also written to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

Sangham president Achyuta Rao, while speaking to reporters, said the students were made to undress and stand for arriving late. Such kind of punishment leaves a lasting impact on the psyche of children, and can even plunge them into depression.

Rao has also asked the Chittoor Superintendent of Police to register a tight case against the teachers, and school management personnel involved. The accused should be booked under the stringent provisions of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act.

Based on the complaint, a case has been registered against a teacher of the high school who punished the students in such brutal manner, the Punganur circle inspector said.

Several students' organisations in Chittoor also raised the issue. A protest was staged earlier in the day, demanding the administration to shut down the school as it is not recognised by the government.","Andhra Pradesh: 4 Students Forced to Strip in Chittoor School For Coming Late | LatestLY","1027705302","2018-12-27","https://www.latestly.com/india/news/andhra-pradesh-4-students-forced-to-strip-in-chittoor-school-for-coming-late-561370.html","Latestly",FALSE
"5423","","JAGATSINGHPUR: After the State Government recently released a list of schools functioning without no objection certificate (NOC), names of more and more defaulting institutions are coming to the fore.

In the latest case, District Child Protection Officer Kanhu Charan Rout has lodged a complaint against Maa Ambika SC/ST Residential School, Sidhal for running a school by producing forged documents, harassing and humiliating students.

The school was opened in 1992 and the management of the residential school had obtained NOC by submitting a fake land document and other infrastructure. After obtaining NOC from the District Education Officer, Jagatsinghpur, the Board of Secondary Education gave permission to conduct examinations. Meanwhile, the villagers brought allegations of lack of facilities and harassment of students by engaging them in the agriculture field or domestic work.

They alleged that school authorities have pressed the children, including girls, in domestic work and cultivation of paddy crops in the land. The students were also tortured when they refused to do these activities. The parents also alleged that though the strength of the residential school is about 170 from Classes I to X, the stipend of Rs 1,200 was being availed against 300 students.

Acting on the complaint, Collector Yamini Sarangi sought details on the school's infrastructure like toilets, kitchen, drinking water facilities, boundary wall, safety measures and other documents in August.

The school was also asked to comply with the shortcomings within 15 days but the management failed to do so following which the administration obtained permission from the Government and closed the school.

Despite the closure of the school, the management was running it illegally. Inspector-in-charge of Jagatsinghpur police station Rajani Kant Mishra said after receiving allegations, police registered a case against the president, secretary and headmaster of the school as their names are mentioned in the FIR under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and an investigation is on.","School in Odisha's Jagatsinghpur functions without NOC, students forced to do menial jobs","1023791516","2018-12-21","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/dec/21/school-functions-without-nocstudents-forced-to-do-menial-jobs-1914554.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"5424","","The Central European University, founded by George Soros, said on Monday, December 3, 2018, that it had been forced out of Hungary in ""an arbitrary eviction"" that violated academic freedom, and it confirmed plans to enrol new students in neighbouring Austria next year.

CEU's statement is the culmination of a years-long struggle between Hungarian-born but U.S.-based Mr. Soros, who promotes liberal causes through his charities, and the nationalist, anti-immigrant government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

""CEU has been forced out,"" said CEU President and Rector Michael Ignatieff in a statement. ""This is unprecedented. A U.S. institution has been driven out of a country that is a NATO ally. A European institution has been ousted from a member state of the EU.""

""Arbitrary eviction of a reputable university is a flagrant violation of academic freedom. It is a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary,"" the statement added.

CEU's legal status has been in limbo for more than a year since changes to a higher education law that meant a foreign-registered university could no longer operate in Hungary unless it also provided courses in its home country.

Mr. Orban's critics say the changes deliberately target CEU, which is reguarly ranked as the top university in Hungary and offers U.S. degrees. Mr. Orban accuses Mr. Soros of encouraging mass immigration into Europe, a charge the philanthropist denies.

Earlier this year, Open Society Foundations, Mr. Soros' main funding network, was also forced to leave Hungary. CEU, founded in Budapest in 1991, has repeatedly said it has complied with all the new regulations set by Mr. Orban's government, which has refused to sign off on an already agreed document with the State of New York that would allow CEU to stay.

Hungary's government has dismissed the university's move as a ""Soros-style bluff.""

CEU said it would start enrolling students for U.S. degrees at its new campus in Vienna for the next academic year. Students already enrolled will complete their studies in Budapest.

The university retains accreditation as a Hungarian university and will seek to continue teaching and research activity in Budapest as long as possible, it said.","George Soros' graduate school says it is being forced out of Hungary","1010078307","2018-12-04","https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/george-soros-graduate-school-says-it-is-being-forced-out-of-hungary/article25662505.ece","The Hindu",FALSE
"5425","","By Marton Dunai and Krisztina Than

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The Central European University, founded by billionaire George Soros, said on Monday it had been forced out of Hungary in ""an arbitrary eviction"" that violated academic freedom, and it confirmed plans to open a new campus in Austria.

CEU's statement is the culmination of a years-long struggle between Hungarian-born but U.S.-based Soros, who promotes liberal causes through his charities, and the nationalist, anti-immigrant government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

For nearly three decades CEU has been a gateway to the West for thousands of students from ex-communist eastern Europe, offering U.S.-accredited degree programmes in an academic climate that celebrates free thought.

The university said it would leave Budapest if it had not secured guarantees of academic freedom by Dec. 1.

""CEU has been forced out,"" said CEU President and Rector Michael Ignatieff in a statement. ""This is unprecedented. A U.S. institution has been driven out of a country that is a NATO ally. A European institution has been ousted from a member state of the EU.""

""Arbitrary eviction of a reputable university is a flagrant violation of academic freedom. It is a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary,"" CEU's statement added.

Ignatieff told a news conference later that the CEU had received a ""clear and unequivocal"" welcome in Austria.

The United States said it was ""disappointed"" that CEU was unable to remain in Hungary.

The European Commission, which has taken Hungary to the EU's supreme court over the education law that prompted the CEU move and has clashed with Orban over democracy issues, said it was ""deeply concerned"".

The law ""needs to be brought back in line with EU law"", said an EU spokesman. ""It is now for the Court (of Justice of the European Union) to clarify this matter.""

Guy Verhofstadt, the liberal leader in the European Parliament and a former Belgian prime minister, said Orban should feel ""shame"", adding that it was the first time since Oslo University was forced to close by Norway's Nazi German occupiers in 1943 that a European university had been shut down.

LONG BATTLE

CEU's legal status has been in limbo for more than a year since changes to a higher education law that meant a foreign-registered university could no longer operate in Hungary unless it also provided courses in its home country.

"5427","","PITHORAGARH: Young girls from Rautgara village in Pithoragarh tehsil are forced to skip school for at least five days every month when they are menstruating as a temple dedicated to a local deity falls along the way to the institution.

Locals believe that the temple would be desecrated if women on their periods were to pass the area which has led parents to confine menstruating girls to their homes. In fact, the taboo has forced a few of the girls determined to get a good education to move to nearby cities and towns where they are staying with relatives. A team of the local administration will now be sent to counsel parents to allow girls to attend classes.

The issue was brought to fore when a team from the NGO Uttarakhand Mahila Manch visited the area. Uma Bhatt who led the team told TOI that girls from the village who attend Sail Government Intercollege have been skipping school for up to five days during their period. ""A temple dedicated to local deity Chamu Devta falls on the route to school. Teachers have been trying to encourage girls to attend classes but parents fear backlash from the community and thus don't allow the girls to go to school,"" Bhatt said.

A former teacher at the school requesting anonymity said, ""People here are very conservative.

On August 15 the principal hoisted the tricolour in the presence of all staff members, but students were not invited as there was possibility of rain and the school ground was slushy, he said.

The next day, activists of Hindu Sena, a local organisation, and some parents reached the school and demanded apology from the principal for not inviting students for the Independence Day function, Stephen alleged.

They then took the boy to the washroom and took turns to sodomise him.

The world may not be such a happy place, but until a few years ago, schools were considered to be safe havens for students. It was a place where they not just learnt their lessons and about life in general, they made friends and enjoyed their time under the watchful eyes of the teachers. However, things aren't the same anymore and schools are fast becoming a place where students sometimes go through very tough and traumatising times.

In a shocking incident, the father of a student of Mayo College, Ajmer, has alleged that his son was sexually assaulted and sodomised by six of his seniors. The class 11 student was reportedly abused multiple times by six class 12 boarders between July 10 and 26.

The family of the boy filed a complaint against the students at the Alwar Gate police station on Tuesday, July 31.

Speaking of the complaint, Priti Chaudhary, deputy superintendent of police, who is investigating the case, told Hindustan Times: ""We have registered a case on the father's complaint under different sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POSCO) Act against six named students of Mayo College and are investigating. It is very early to say anything on this.""

In the complaint, in which the school's management committee is a co-complainant, the father of the student said that the class 12 boys barged into his son's room on July 10 and forced him to consume alcohol and take drugs. They then took the boy to the washroom and took turns to sodomise him.

""Each time they sexually abused my son, they forced him to take drugs. They threatened him of dire consequences if he reported the incident to anyone,"" he added.

The boy's ordeal continued until July 26, when he finally left the school and told his parents about the abuse. ""He is under great distress and is deeply disturbed. This was his first year in the boarding school,"" the father added.

Even though Mayo College's management committee is a co-complainant, the school has refused to comment on the case. ""The police is investigating the matter, let's wait for the findings; I have nothing more to say at this juncture,"" Mayo college's principal and director Surendra Kulkarni told HT.

Just weeks ago, a class nine student of a private school in Bihar's Saran district alleged that she was raped by about 18 people in her school over the last eight months. The 18 people include the school's principal, two of the teachers and 15 other students.

The girl explained that she remained quiet for all these months fearing social stigma, but approached the police later and filed a complaint alleging that she was raped since December 2017. She explained that three of her schoolmates had raped in the school toilet in December and shot a video of the act. They then warned her against telling anyone and said that they would make the video public.

Even though she did not discuss the incident with anyone, the students circulated the video that even reached the teachers. However, instead of taking action, they too are said to have blackmailed and raped her.

"5458","","The locals refused to let her work, claiming that the midday meals cooked by her are ""impure"".

Police in the Cheyur town of Tamil Nadu have caught seven men, who have been accused of harassing a Dalit cook. The victim works at a government school kitchen and was recently forced to resign from her job.

The Cheyur Police have sent the accused to judicial custody for 15 days.

The accused have been identified as Palanichamy (61), Moorthy (47), Sakthivel (42), Kandasamy (42), Shanmugam (40), Palanisamy (40) and Moorthy (27).

Why was the Dalit woman targeted?

The 42-year-old victim, Paappal, belongs to a scheduled caste community and lives near Avinashi in Tiruppur.

She had been appointed in the government school to prepare midday meals for the students. Paappal has said that she was harassed last week by members from the Gounder community. The locals refused to let her work, claiming that the meals cooked by her are ""impure"" as she belongs to the scheduled caste community, reported The News Minute.

Further, the parents of children protested last week asking for Paappal's removal and warned the school that they will not send their children to school unless she leaves. Not only this, the locals who were protesting against Paappal also locked her in the school for around three hours and put pressure on the school principal to follow their demands.

The principal complained to the Block Development Officer (BDO) of Avinashi. However, the BDO allegedly gave a nod to the parents' demands and issued a transfer order of Paappal.

Paappal has claimed that this is not the first time that she has faced harassment over her caste

Police investigation into the matter

After Pappal's complaint, the Cheyur police have registered an FIR against 80 people under Sections 147 (Punishment for rioting), 506(i) (Criminal intimidation), 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 294(b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place) of the IPC.

"5460","","England school is advising UK-born children, who fear being taken overseas to be married, to hide spoons inside their undergarments which will trigger metal detectors at airports.(Representative Image/AFP Phot o)

A school in England has devised a novel way to prevent UK-born children being taken to India and other Asian countries and being forced into marriages -- it is handing out spoons to be hidden inside undergarments and thus trigger metal detectors at airports.

Harinder Kaur from the Co-operative Academy in Leeds has urged pupils to hide the cutlery in their undergarments if they fear they are being taken overseas to be married. It will trigger metal detectors at airports, allowing them to raise the alarm with security staff privately.

British authorities deal with several cases of forced marriages in India and other countries, when parents take children on the pretext of a holiday or meeting relatives, and then force them into marriage with local partners for family honour or visa reasons.

In 2017, the Forced Marriage Unit in the Foreign Office dealt with 82 cases linked to India. Figures released by the FMU in May showed that India was among its top four countries of focus during 2017 with 82 cases. The other countries on the list were Pakistan (439 cases), Bangladesh (129) and Somalia (91).

Kaur told BBC that the spoons can ""save lives...In the six-week holidays we know there is no contact between school and the family and families have that opportunity to go abroad, get their child married and come back. It's a way of making our children aware there is a safety net"".

She said that 80% of UK forced marriages happened abroad during the summer holidays.

""The proportion of cases linked to India in 2017 was similar to 2016. There was a higher proportion of older victims as well as male victims this is most likely due to the fact that many of these cases were reluctant sponsors,"" a statistical of the FMU note said.

It noted that the cases are not broken down by religion: ""(No) major faith in the UK advocates forced marriage. It is also important to note that freely given consent is a prerequisite of Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh marriages.""

Of the 82 India-linked cases, the largest number - 29 - were reported from London, followed by the West Midlands (14) and the East Midlands (12), which have a large population of Indian origin in cities such as Leicester, Wolverhampton and Birmingham.

Official sources say a forced marriage is one in which one or both spouses do not (or, in the case of some adults with learning or physical disabilities or mental incapacity, cannot) consent to the marriage and violence, threats, or any other form of coercion is involved.

""Coercion may include emotional force, physical force or the threat of physical force, and, financial pressure. In an arranged marriage, both parties have consented to the union but can still refuse to marry if they choose to,"" the statistical note said.

The pressure put on people to marry against their will can be physical (including threats, actual physical violence and sexual violence) or emotional and psychological (for example, when someone is made to feel like they're bringing shame on their family). Financial abuse (taking your wages or not giving you any money) can also be a factor.

Set up in January 2005, the FMU operates both inside the UK, where support is provided to any individual, and overseas, where consular assistance is provided to British nationals, including dual nationals.","UK school has a 'spoon' solution to marriages forced by desi parents","905368736","2018-07-14","https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-school-has-a-spoon-solution-to-marriages-forced-by-desi-parents/story-uGk1O7kXZ7b3tyIUb471OP.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"5465","","Coimbatore: Class XI science group students at the government higher secondary school at Bujanganur near Karamadai are allegedly forced to either take up arts group or leave the school, as the student strength has dropped drastically.

Without handing over the textbooks to the students of biology and computer science groups, the school management has been forcing them to take up arts group, said a teacher from the school, requesting anonymity.

The strength of science group students has come down to just nine from more than 40 s until a couple of years ago after the introduction of National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), the teacher added.

Whenever the books are sought, the only answer from the principal is that they are planning to wind up the group, the teacher said and added that they were teaching the students with the soft copy of the books, which have been downloaded to mobile phones. ""Apart from notes, the students have nothing to rely on,"" the teacher added.

Only those students aspiring to become doctors and engineers have chosen the science group, the teacher said. The school offers six streams in science group.

Enrolment to all the six streams has come down this year. If the school decided to wind them up, students have to travel long distances to study in the government school at Karamadai or Velliankadu, the teacher added.

""Without taking up any private coaching, two students from the school have cracked the NEET,"" the teacher said hinting indirectly that the decision to do away with the science group may hit the rural students very badly.

In a story that is sure to set a new benchmark in terms of the affection and respect that teachers can earn from students, the transfer of an English teacher at government high school teacher in Tiruvallur, north of Chennai, had to be delayed by 10 days following an unusual protest from students.

28-year-old G Bhagawan was one of the two English teachers at school and was transferred along with one more as part of a routine redeployment of staff to maintain the teacher-student ratio in government schools.

The students, however, were left shocked by the move to transfer their favourite teacher and launched a protest on Wednesday. The protest saw over 100 students from various classes of Government High School in Veliagaram virtually holding the teacher hostage after learning of his transfer to another school in the region.

The principal of the school A Aravindan told The Indian Express that Bhagwan had completed the process to leave the school but was stopped by the students.

""Bhagawan was teaching English from 6th to 10th standard. Transfer orders came on Tuesday. Another teacher came to the school on Wednesday at 9 am, completed procedures and left to join the new school before 10 am. But Bhagawan, who got delayed in the process, was stopped by students,"" he was quoted as saying.

He said that students had also informed their parents about the transfer of both the English teachers and they also reached the school leading to dramatic events. Aravindan added that Bhagwan was one of the best teachers of his school.

""I was told to wait for 10 days to execute the transfer order. Parents are realising that it is part of the usual process,"" Aravindan said.

The Parents and Teachers' Association (PTA) also reached out to local MP PM Narasimhan asking him to cancel the transfer order. However, he convinced PTA members that the transfer was a part of the regular procedure.

Speaking about this emotional reception, Bhagwan said that his colleague who got transferred had left before him. He revealed that the students had even taken away his scooter key and snatched his bag as well.

""I was stopped by students when I stepped out of the office. They took away my scooter key first. Then they snatched my bag, crying and shouting loudly.

"5467","","An 18-year-old student in Osaka, Japan, has filed a lawsuit against the local government after she says her public high school repeatedly forced her to dye her naturally brown hair black -- or risk being kicked out of the school for good.

Local media sites report that students of Kaifukan School, in Habikino City, are required by school policy to have black hair, as many students naturally do. The Japan Times says that this rule led the student's mother to contact the school before enrolling her daughter in 2015 to inform them that her hair was naturally brown, and had not been dyed, bleached, or artificially colored in any way. But officials at the school continually ordered the student to dye it black to fit their guidelines -- as frequently as every four days, according to the Tokyo Reporter. Even after following the initial order, the school reportedly claimed that it was ""not enough."" The student says that the constant dyeing eventually burned her scalp and caused painful rashes.

Now, the teenager is suing the Osaka Prefectural Government for ¥2.2 million (about $19,000) in damages, on the grounds that she was forced to dye her hair so often that it constituted abuse. Her mother first lodged a complaint with the school, but it was dismissed, and the student stopped attending classes in September 2016.

A survey conducted by Osaka-based newspaper The Asahi Shimbun this past May found that nearly 60% of public high schools in Tokyo request that students with brown or light-colored hair provide ""proof"" in the form of childhood or junior-high photos to verify that their hair color is real. The publication says that this practice is in place to protect students by preventing schools from ""scolding or humiliating"" those whose hair is not naturally black, because it seems unusual and is therefore treated as strange. (Another way to protect students is to not scold or humiliate them by treating any physical appearance that doesn't fit mainstream beauty standards as unusual.)

This unfortunate incident is a particularly severe example of how rules are enforced to not only restrict self-expression, but also to create homogeny. As outrageous as it seems, it's not an anomaly -- as many students in the U.S. unfortunately know full well.","This Student Is Suing Her School After Being Forced To Dye Her Hair Black | Oye!

A medical college that boast an affiliation with Columbia University has booked a commencement speaker who was terminated from his position as CEO in 2017 amid sexual harassment allegations.

Bradley Bakotic, a podiatrist who founded a lab-testing company, is slated to give the keynote address and receive an honorary Doctor of Science degree at The New York College of Podiatric Medicine's commencement ceremony in late May.But Bakotic's presence at the school, which graduates 25% of all practicing podiatrists, may raise some eyebrows, given his past.

Bakotic is a founder of Bako Diagnostics, a company that does lab testing for podiatry practices. Private equity firm Consonance Capital Partners took a big stake in his company in 2016. As part of that deal, Bakotic received $30.4 million at the time, while his co-founder Joseph Hackel got $14.4 million.

In September 2017, Bakotic was terminated from his company following an investigation of accusations of sexual harassment allegations, engaging in a sexual relationship with subordinates at the company, use of illicit drugs, and battery of an employee, according to court documents. An investigation conducted by law firm Latham and Watkins verified those claims.

A representative from the New York College of Podiatric Medicine declined to comment when asked if the school was aware of Bakotic's background when he was asked to speak at commencement.

"5470","","Coimbatore: Parents of students studying at St Joseph's Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Ondipudur staged a protest in front of the school on Thursday alleging that the school had forced students from class VI to class IX, who were not good at studies, get transfer certificates (TC).

About 30 parents, who had gathered in front of the school, said the school management had been pressuring them to shift their children to other schools as their wards were weak in studies. ""The authorities told us that the school would detain our wards for one year or else they said we had to shift our wards to other schools,"" said the parent of a class VIII student. ""Last year, they had given my child a 'warning promotion', meaning if he didn't perform well the next year, they would detain him. This year, they are asking me to move my child to another school,"" he said.

Also, some parents said when they approached the school management for TC, the authorities asked them for a letter stating they had got the TC willingly. ""How can we give such a letter when the school management had forced us into taking TCs,"" said another parent, who had approached the school on Monday to get TC for his child, a class VI student.

On Thursday, when the parents gathered in front of the school, the management held talks with four of them. Another meeting is scheduled for Friday.

Meanwhile, Fr A Maria Joseph, principal of the school, said the school management had not forced any parent to get TC. ""We had just highlighted the positions of students, who were not performing well in academics. In the case where both the parents were working, we asked them to devote more time to their children's studies.

On Saturday, Alternative Innovative Education (AIE) volunteer Vaneeta, 32, lodged a complaint with education minister Aruna Chaudhary; secretary education, Punjab, Krishan Kumar; and the ministry of woman and child welfare, demanding action against officials of the district education department.

Earlier, Vaneeta taught in Government Primary School, Mandi. In February, the local education department transferred her to Government Primary Central Girl School which was 3km away from Mandi school. Since she was pregnant for two months, doctors recommended her bed rest.

Thereafter, she approached the block primary education officer (BPEO), central master trainer (CMT), block master trainer (BMT) requesting them to stop her transfer, but to no avail. She also approached the district education officer (elementary) and deputy district education officer (elementary), but got no response.

Vaneeta said, ""I approached all officials, but they did not listen to my pleas."" ""When the officials did not listen, I joined duty. The first day I got an auto-rickshaw to reach the school, but the bumpy ride left me in severe pain. On days, I did not even get even an auto-rickshaw and I had to walk for three kms to reach the school,"" she added.

""I lost my baby all due to the physical and mental stress. All officials of the district education department, whom I had approached, are responsible for my miscarriage,"" said Vaneeta.

The teacher and her husband have also submitted a complaint with the teacher union and Navchetana Bal Bhalai Committee, an organisation of local government teachers. The organisation has further taken up the complaint with the education minister.

"5472","","JAGATSINGHPUR: At a time when primary education in the State is in dire straits due to lack of adequate infrastructure and teachers, an incident of students being allegedly forced to clean toilets in a school has sparked public outcry in Tirtol block of the district.Parents and guardians on Thursday demanded action against teachers who allegedly engaged students in cleaning toilets at Tulang Project UP school. On Tuesday, students of the school were allegedly forced to clean toilets by teachers.

The incident came to light after a student, Parsuram Khuntia of Class VI, informed his parents that teachers in the school were making him and other students clean the toilets. Parsuram also refused to attend classes over the issue.Students should not be engaged in any work other than studies in schools. Asking the children to clean toilets is unlawful and an act of infringement on child rights, said Ward member Subash Mohanty.

Parsuram's father Khetramohan is a leprosy patient and mother Satyabhama is suffering from cancer. They are unable to take care of the kid. Taking advantage of the situation, the school headmaster and other teachers engaged Parsuram and other poor students to clean toilets and school floor on a daily basis, Mohanty alleged. As many as 64 students are enrolled in Tulang Project UP School. Headmistress Suajata Nayak said, ""As there are no sweeper and peon, we asked the students to clean toilets and school premises. It is routine affair.""

After being informed by their son about his plight in school, Khetramohan and Satyabhama took up the matter with Collector Yamini Sarangi. The Collector directed District Education Officer (DEO) Prativa Manjari Das to conduct an inquiry into the allegations.Das said on the direction of the Collector, Tirtol Block Education Officer has been asked to conduct an inquiry into the allegation. ""If any teacher is found guilty, stern action will be taken,"" she added.

This is not the first case of teachers forcing students to clean school toilets in the district. Earlier in 2014, headmaster and a teacher of Karilo Primary school in Kujang block had engaged Dalit kids to clean toilets. In 2015, students of Olara UP School in Erasama block were found colouring the building and kitchen rooms. Last year, teachers had allegedly made students clean the toilets of Nehru Memorial UP School at Jota village in Salijanga panchayat of Jagatsinghpur block.","Pupils 'forced' to clean school loos  ","840937641","2018-03-30","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/mar/30/pupils-forced-to-clean-school-loos-1794624.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"5474","","Kolkata: West Bengal's education minister Partha Chaterjee on Wednesday stirred a controversy by supporting the Kolkata school that had allegedly forced a bunch of Class IX students to sign ""confessional statements"" that they indulged in ""lesbian"" acts within the school's premises.

The minister, claiming that ""lesbianism is against our culture"", said the school was free to take any action it deemed fit. ""We believe we should maintain our culture. If the school found it was indecent, it is free to take action against those students,"" he said.

He further said that he had learnt that the students were lesbians through media reports and has asked his department to investigate this issue. ""We have sought a report form the school,"" he said.

The minister's remarks came despite the Kamala Girls' School rubbishing the allegations that 10 girls were summoned to the office of the headmistress on March 8 and were made to sign such statements in the school's bid to ""discipline students who were up to mischief"". Parents of the girls reportedly stormed into the headmistress's chamber on Monday and confronted her for the act.

Speaking to News18 on Wednesday, the acting headmistress Sikha Sarkar said, ""No such incident happened in our school. There were some disciplinary issues and some miscommunication with parents and it was resolved in a meeting with the students and their parents.""

""I have strong objection to the word 'lesbian' used by a section of the media. While running a school we face several issues related to student's future and discipline. It's our duty to guide them towards right direction. I don't know from where the issue of lesbianism came into the picture,"" she added.

Asked about the so-called 'confession letter' she said: ""We have not asked anyone to write such a letter. I would like to request you, not to sensationalize the matter. I think it was blown out of proportion.""

The acting headmistress, however, admitted that the girls were made to write a statement saying they indulged in ""mischief"", but refused to explain what that word meant.

Parents, however, alleged that the school authorities were using the incident to shift focus from the alleged molestation of a student by a non-teaching staff of the school on February 9. The accused staff, Malay Barua, was later arrested.

Talking to News18, father of one of the students who was allegedly forced to write the so-called ""confessional letter"" said: ""There were three eyewitnesses to the molestation and all four girls involved in the previous incident were among the 10 girls who were forced to sign the statement on March 8. The incident was even videographed by school authorities.""

He asserted that nothing has been sorted out between the school authorities and the parents as claimed by the acting headmistress.

President of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE), Dr. Kalyanmoy Ganguly, refused to comment on the matter on grounds that he was busy with the Board exams.

Dr. Saumitra Mohan, Commissioner of School Education, also denied knowledge about the incident.","'Lesbianism Against Culture': Bengal Minister Backs School That Forced Girls to 'Confess'","831346855","2018-03-14","https://www.news18.com/news/india/lesbianism-against-culture-bengal-minister-backs-school-that-forced-girls-to-confess-1688839.html","News18",FALSE
"5475","","BELAGAVI: Students of Government Urdu School No 5 in Belagavi are having to hold their bladders or run to relieve themselves in a dangerous gutter located about 200 metres away from it, beside a railway track at New Gandhi Nagar in Belagavi. It does not have facilities like toilets, drinking water and even faces dearth of classrooms since a portion of its building collapsed two years ago during rainy season.

If anyone wants to gauge the government's sanitation programme success rate, a visit to Government Urdu School No 5 will give them a good understanding. According to the staff members of the school, when the portion of the school collapsed, only a portion of the toilet was damaged. Students, especially girls, continued to utilise them. It was demolished 15 days ago, they added. The staff said that elder girl students, when they go home for lunch during break time, they utilise their toilets at home and return. They said that most of the students reside close to the school.

But the students of the school had a different story to tell. They have been urinating in an open gutter near a railway track since the building collapsed. Few temporary mobile toilets were brought to the school premises but they were not fitted and so remain unused, they alleged. One of the school staff members, on condition of anonymity, said, ""Our misery cannot be explained in words. Students are forced to relieve themselves in the open. But the situation of older school girls especially during menstruation and even lady teachers is worse.""

This school has a total of 595 students and among them, 399 are girls. After the building collapse incident, it has been facing dearth of classrooms. The madrassa just beside the school provided its community hall premises, which is being utilised as classrooms. The huge open and deep gutter, which is utilised as toilets by students, may prove life threatening to them, if they accidentally fall into it. The school does not have a compound wall, due to which several students jump over the gutter and cross the railway track to reach their homes, which is again dangerous. These issues have been persisting for a long time but they are not being looked into by authorities concerned despite being brought to light several times, alleged parents of a few students. They said that they themselves had met a few authorities and even local public representative.","Govt school students forced to use drains near railway track as toilets","825611828","2018-03-05","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2018/mar/06/govt-school-students-forced-to-use-drains-near-railway-track-as-toilets-1782720.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

For the past few days, students at a government school in Madhya Pradesh's Tikamgarh district are being forced to take their exams on the terrace of their school and amid the din caused by a cultural programme organised by a local BJP MLA.

In the memory of a former MLA Late Sunil Naik, a volleyball tournament and other cultural events are being organised in a government-run higher secondary school in the district that is clashing with the final exams of students of 9th and 11th standard. Between both events, the priority has been given to the former.

To that effect, the students can be found seated on the school's terrace as their classrooms have been occupied due to the events. To add to their discomfort, they also have to face the blaring music of the cultural programmes.

On Thursday,while the students could be seen struggling to write their paper, state's Minister Lalita Yadav, Tikamgarh Collector Abhijeet Agrawal, and the local MLA Anita Naik were busy watching the cultural events.

On asking the District administration whether any action was being taken against this, District education officer, B L Luhariya told ANI that he was unaware of the incident and was yet to receive any complaint.","As MP ministers enjoy cultural event at Tikamgarh school, students forced to write exams on terrace amid blaring music","810293069","2018-02-10","http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-as-mp-ministers-enjoy-cultural-event-at-tikamgarh-school-students-forced-to-write-exams-on-terrace-amid-blaring-music-2583211","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE

""But, teachers have told us that it is our classroom and we should maintain it. So, we pool money to buy everything,"" she said. What's worse, the students have also been told to mop the floors and clean the rooms twice a week. ""The sweepers appointed by the corporation will sweep only the verandah and the ground. They do not clean the floors of the classrooms,"" said Raji. As a result, the students have to mop the floors of all the 13 classrooms in the school.

The corporation had deputed a private contractor to employ two sweepers and a security guard at the school. The contractor, however, is still being paid monthly for the maintenance of the school premises, a corporation official said.

Their parents are not so happy about spending money for the upkeep of the school, the students said. ""We have to buy new mops every three months,"" said a student.

Absence of a watchman during the working hours is another problem. ""Whenever we do not bring lunch, we have no way but to buy food from shops. Earlier, a security guard used to help us buy food. But, now we only have a night watchman. The school does not have a canteen or a store to purchase food from,"" said a student.

Meanwhile, the school headmistress told TOI that the students clean the facility on their own volition. ""They are doing it on their own to keep the classrooms clean. We haven't asked them to buy chalk pieces and other items. We have purchase bills for that,"" she said.

One of the UK's leading state-funded schools which had hit the headlines as one of the first to impose a ban on the hijab for girls under eight has been forced to reverse its decision after widespread criticism. St Stephen's School in Newham, east London, had been planning to extend the ban to girls under 11 later this year but has chosen to withdraw the plans.

""The school's uniform policy is based on the health, safety and welfare of our children. The school has taken the decision to make changes to this policy with immediate effect and this follows on from conversations with our school community,"" the school said in a statement. ""We will work with our school community to continue to review this policy going forward in the best interests of our children,"" it adds.

Arif Qawi, the chair of governors of the school who had recently called on the UK government to take a firm stand on young children wearing the hijab and fasting during Ramadan, resigned from his post on Friday. According to 'The Sunday Times', the resignation followed offensive messages posted on social media against him and the school's Indian-origin principal Neena Lall.

""Now the head-teacher needs to go. Kick her out and force her to wear hijab. Let her see what forcing means,"" one of the messages against Lall reads. Under the UK's Department for Education guidelines, uniform policy is a matter for individual head-teachers and their governing bodies.

The school, with a majority of pupils from Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds, had urged the UK government to issue clear guidelines on the issue of hijab-wearing and religious fasting relating to very young pupils to prevent a backlash from parents. ""The department should step up and take it out of our hands and tell every school this is how it [fasting] should be... The same for the hijab, it should not be our decision. It is unfair to teachers and very unfair to governors. We are unpaid. Why should we get the backlash,"" Qawi had said.

Amina Lone, co-founder of the UK's Social Action and Research Foundation who has campaigned for young girls not to have to wear the hijab, warned that after his resignation other schools in the country would find themselves under pressure if the Department for Education did not issue clear guidelines. ""These issues are not going away,"" she said.

The Department for Education said it is a matter for individual schools to decide how to ""accommodate children observing Ramadan, and to set uniform policies"".

""But we would expect them to consider the needs of their pupils, and to listen to the views of local parents,"" a spokesperson said.

""We have taken the step in compliance with the Uttarakhand High Court's orders. The court has listed some standards, which need to be followed by all vehicles ferrying school children. Those found overloading or not following the other standards shall be given a challan,"" Assistant regional transport officer Arvind Kumar Pandey said.

""The vehicles will be seized only in the rarest of rare cases, as per HC's order. After the challan, the vehicle owners will be given time to make sure they comply with the provisions. If they are found in serious violation of the norms or are observed to be a repeat offender, then the department official can seize their vehicle,"" Pandey added.

Reacting to the move, president of school van association Rajeev Bajaj said, ""This move has become a serious cause of concern for all the owners and drivers of school vans. This poses a threat to our livelihood. We pay Rs 20,000 annually for insurance followed by fitness tax, road tax and other taxes. Now we are in danger of being fined every other day. It seems as if we are not ferrying children but indulging in a criminal activity.""

There are more than 200 schools in Dehradun. Fifty per cent of these are senior secondary schools. Due to limited number of buses, most of these schools are unable to provide transportation facility to students. As a result, parents tie up with private vans that ferry their children to and fro from school. Currently, there are about 450 such vans operating in the city.

For many parents, vans are the best option for their children. ""My son studies in Class 6. It has been more than five years since he started going to school by a van. During these five years, I never got a reason to complain against the van or its driver. I'm at peace knowing my child is in secure hands,"" said Monika Bhatia whose son is a student as St. Joseph's Academy.

However, many also cited problems with the vans. ""Both my sons go to school by a van. Their school starts at 7.40am and it takes around 15 minutes to reach the school from our house. Still, they get up at 5.30 am every day as the van comes to pick them up before 6.30,"" said Achint Jain whose sons study at an elite public school. ""The kids have often complained of the van being crowded as the drivers sometimes carry up to 14 children at one time,"" he added.

Jennifer Kumar, the president of ICSE Schools' Association of the city said the students will be much safer if they travel by school buses or vehicles owned and operated by the school. But he also acknowledged the lack of the same. ""However, the schools cannot be held responsible for the private vehicles ferrying the students as it is not possible to keep a track of all of them. In this case, it is the parents' responsibility to ensure that the safety of their child is in the right hands. They should be thorough in their background check before sending their wards with drivers of these private vehicles,"" he said.","Overloading: RTO to inspect every school bus and van in Dehradun every day ","913410901","2018-07-26","https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/overloading-rto-to-inspect-every-school-bus-and-van-in-dehradun-every-day/story-nAJeNd4khA8jIP2eJPw2kM.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"5487","","CHENNAI: THE First Bench of the HC has directed the State to constitute a panel, headed by the Chief Educational Officer (CEO) and comprising other experts, in all districts to inspect schools and ensure that they conform to the regulations and safety norms with regard to buildings.

The provisions of the National Building Code shall also be taken note of, said the Bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Abdul Quddhose, while passing interim orders on a PIL petition from A Narayanan of Change India on Monday.

Directing the School Education Department, Central Board of Secondary Education, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and Directorate of Town and Country Planning to file their respective counter-affidavits within a week, the Bench posted to April 9 further hearing on the PIL.

The petition sought a directive to ensure that government, aided and unaided schools strictly comply with part-IV relating to fire and life safety and the code of practice of fire safety in educational institutions of the Bureau of Indian Standards enumerated in National Building Code 2005, as directed by the Supreme Court.

According to petitioner, while disposing of a PIL, pursuant to the Kumbakonam school fire tragedy in 2004, the SC on April 13, 2009, issued a set of directives to all States and to ensure safety of schoolkids.

Unfortunately, the National Building Code of India 2005 and the directives remained only on paper.

Several unrecognised schools were allowed to function. Many were functioning in dangerous buildings and many have neither recognition from the School Education Department nor affiliation to the CBSE. Such schools are existing in congested localities without proper lighting, ventilation and fire safety. Many schools function right on busy roads, but without even a compound wall. Even godowns and commercial complexes have been converted into schools, he said.","Set up panel to inspect school buildings: Madras High Court","834668691","2018-03-19","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/mar/20/set-up-panel-to-inspect-school-buildings-madras-high-court-1789759.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

Deputy Commissioner Srinagar, Dr Syed Abid Rasheed Shah, Friday directed for immediate inspection of private schools across the district to ascertain the complaints of exorbitant pricing of books and uniforms provided to students in schools.

The DC taking a strong note of the complaints directed for joint inspection by concerned executive magistrates of the district and ZEOs from the Education department to inspect schools in all educational zones of the district and submit reports within three days.

Dr Shah said education is a social cause and must not be allowed to be commercialized. He said the district administration will ensure that there is strict adherence to the mechanism in place regulating the pricing of books and other related items and that strict action will be taken against any violations. He said the Private Schools Association of the district has also been taken on board on the issue and that the latter has assured of full support in regard to the matter.

"5489","","DPI order to overhaul the process in aided and government schools and make it more self-critical

To an unsuspecting class of primary school students, the teacher darts this question. ""Who is the Prime Minister of Cyprus?""

As the children keep mum, the District Educational Officer (DEO) turns to the teacher and the headmaster for an answer, who by now realise their ignorance and begin mumbling. Akbar Kakkattil, who immortalised school teachers in many of his short stories, ends this popular anecdote on school inspection in his book School Diary, saying the DEO too did not know the answer.

This ritualistic approach of fact-finding by the officials, a favourite theme in many Malayalam short stories, is expected to change soon as the Education Department has decided to overhaul the process of inspection of aided and government schools by officials. In a recent circular, the Director of Public Instruction (DPI) has asked Assistant Educational Officers, DEOs, and Deputy Directors of Education to be more self-critical about it.

Reminding teachers that there has been an unprecedented response to the 'Save public education' programme of the government, the DPI says the enrolment in government and aided schools had gone up considerably of late. Now, it is the responsibility of the educational officers and teachers to respond to the trust of parents by ensuring academic excellence. Inspection of schools is the effective way to do this, says the circular.

""There is need to be more serious towards the monitoring of educational activities in schools. The proposal is to put in place a mechanism to review the feedback [from teachers and students] after inspection. If there is proper intervention, the quality of education will improve,"" K.V. Mohan Kumar, DPI, told The Hindu on Monday.

The circular asks educational officers to inspect the schools in their jurisdiction at least once a year compulsorily, apart from conducting an unscheduled visit. For aided schools, managers should be kept in the loop. Pointing out the consecutive reports of the Accountant General citing the ineffective nature of school inspections, the DPI says it is the responsibility of the officers to travel from one school to another.

""The process should not be an error-finding mechanism. The officer should act as a friend of the teachers and non-teachers and help them achieve academic excellence,"" the circular says. They should check if the benefits of government schemes reach the beneficiaries. Whether the schools have adequate infrastructure such as libraries, laboratories and furniture should be examined, it adds.","School inspection to see a sea change","948671327","2018-09-17","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/school-inspection-to-see-a-sea-change/article24970796.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

"5492","","MYSURU: The regional transport authority has found that only 30 of the 300 educational institutions' buses and vans, which ferry children, follow safety measures laid down by the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety. The authorities have given errant institutions 15 days to ensure their vehicles meet the standards.

The lapses were revealed during an inspection conducted by RTO officials on Friday at Maharaja's College Ground. The inspection comes in the wake of several complaints regarding the lack of safety measures in vehicles ferrying children to school.

RTO officials issued notices to educational institutions to attend an awareness programme on road safety and to bring school and college vehicles for inspection. Around 300 vehicles turned up for inspection. The authorities verified vehicles documents, fitness, and safety measures adopted, the details of the drivers and other details which were specified by the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety.

M Prabhu Swamy, RTO (West), told TOI that of the 300 vehicles, only 30 vehicles were found to have met safety guidelines. ""We conducted thorough inspection of the vehicles and found only 10 per cent, that is only 30 vehicles, had followed all the safety guidelines,"" he said.

Some of the guidelines include horizontal grills on windows, firm door locks, speed governors, GPS tracking and fire extinguishers. The authorities also inspected whether the school vehicle driver had five years of driving experience and wore a uniform and badge.

Swamy said that after the inspection, a checklist was issued to managements of educational institutions. ""After 15 days, institutions should bring their vehicles to the RTO and get their vehicles inspected again. If they are still found violating rules, vehicles will be seized immediately,"" he said.

Swamy warned private unregistered vehicles (vans, cars, autorickshaws etc), which ferry students to educational institutions, that vehicles will be seized if found violating safety rules. ""We will conduct awareness programmes for unregistered vehicles owners also. But during regular inspection, if we find they violate rules, we will seize such vehicles and a case will be filed against the owners.""","RTO inspection reveals 90% school buses flouting safety guidelines - Times of India","888338886","2018-06-16","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/rto-inspection-reveals-90-school-buses-flouting-safety-guidelines/articleshow/64610041.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

All school buses and school vans in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad will have to undergo a safety inspection at the Regional Transport Office (RTO), Pune, which has launched a 're-inspection drive' from June 2 to 18. The 're-inspection' is compulsory for all vehicles, including those with valid fitness certificates. Vehicles that have recently undergone a fitness test or were bought on or after April 1, 2018, are exempt from the inspection.

As part of the drive, about 3,700 school buses registered with Pune RTO will undergo re-inspection between June 2 and 18 at Alandi facility of RTO, Pune.

The decision was taken following the directives of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court regarding safety of children travelling in school buses, vans and autorickshaws.

The school bus transport rules, which came into effect in March 2011, stipulate various regulations on school buses, operators, transport department and school authorities. The rules apply to all vehicles with a seating capacity of more than 12 but do not apply to autorickshaws engaged in ferrying schoolchildren.

""The directives were passed by the High Court in a 2012 case, which has asked RTO officials to make sure that the vehicles involved in transporting schoolchildren follow the rules and regulations issued from time to time. To ensure 100 per cent adherence to the rules, such as installation of speed governor, fire extinguisher, GPS system and driver's licence, etc. We will inspect all the school buses registered with us. Only new buses bought after April 1 and those, which have obtained a fitness certificate post that date, will be exempt,"" said Sanjay Raut, Deputy Regional Transport Officer.

Raut added that to finish re-inspection of all the vehicles, it has been decided that the Alandi testing centre will work on holidays too.

""If a vehicle fails any test or there are lacunae, we will give it the opportunity to fix them,"" said Raut.

Officials said re-inspection was mandatory for both private and school-owned buses, adding that those failing to abide by the rules will not be allowed to operate on city roads.

Raut added that in case there are more than 25 buses at one place, a motor inspector will be appointed to visit the site and inspect the buses there itself.

""The process will be totally free of cost. Vehicle that fulfil school transport rules and regulations will be provided a certificate,"" said Raut.

The Pune School Bus Association said although the move was an unnecessary hassle as the vehicles have to renew fitness certificates every year, the association will not oppose the move as it involves the safety of children.

""The directives have come from the High Court. So let them do it, though we feel it's unncecessary. We are not opposing it since it's for the safety of children...,"" said Rajan Junawane of the association.","From June 2 to 18: RTO launches re-inspection drive for school vehicles","879892404","2018-06-03","http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/from-june-2-to-18-rto-launches-re-inspection-drive-for-school-vehicles-5201934/","The Indian Express",FALSE

With the new academic year just a week away, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has gone into overdrive to complete the inspection of educational institution vehicles and contract carriages engaged in the transportation of students.

While the inspection is already under way, a special inspection clinic for vehicles has been scheduled for this Saturday at Rajagiri School followed by an awareness session for drivers and ayahs engaged in these vehicles.

""Operational condition of speed governors, stocking of first-aid kit and overall mechanical and physical condition of vehicles will be inspected. We plan to check all vehicles deployed for the transportation of students by this month end and those found fit for operations will be issued stickers,"" said Reji P. Varghese, Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer.

According to the data available with MVD, over 1,000 educational institution vehicles have been registered within the Ernakulam RTO limits alone in addition to countless contract carriages roped in both by schools and parents.

Steps will be taken to ensure that only drivers with ten years of experience are behind the wheels of light motor vehicles used to transport students while drivers of heavy vehicles should have a minimum of five years' experience. MVD has issued detailed guidelines to schools and employees of vehicles. For instance, when young children have to cross roads, the ayahs deployed in vehicles should ensure that they safely reach the other side of the road.

Mr. Varghese said that the Deputy Director of Education would issue the guidelines during a meeting to be held with school principals. School authorities are required to keep complete details of contract carriages transporting their students and furnish them to MVD officials on demand. A PTA member of schools should undertake a journey in contract carriages used by students in their schools once in a while and ensure the travel worthiness of the vehicle.

MVD has also warned of stringent action against contract carriages overcrowded with students.

"5503","","BJP's Bairia MLA Surendra Singh and his aides, who allegedly attacked a school inspector in presence of an MP and officers, had earlier said officials should be beaten with shoes if they demand bribe

A Bharatiya Janata Party MLA allegedly roughed up a district inspector of schools (DIOS) during a review meeting in Ballia district of eastern Uttar Pradesh, reportedly in presence of BJP Ballia Member of Parliament Bharat Singh, the District Magistrate and many senior officers in the auditorium of the collectorate on Saturday, September 22. Those who were supposed to protect the DIOS tried their best to hush up the scandal, but it went viral on social media sites.

After Education Department officers across Uttar Pradesh watched the clipping of the incident and were agitated over the manhandling of the school inspector, Bairia MLA Surendra Singh, who had left the meeting hall after thrashing Narendra Deo, came to the bungalow of the District Magistrate Bhawani Singh Khangarot after two hours and apologised to the Deo. The lawmaker also reportedly ensured that the video of him standing before the officer and apologising was circulated on social media sites.

Singh and his aides allegedly attacked Deo, when the latter was trying to reply to the MLA's allegation that he was not solving day-to-day problems of teachers. Later, the DM took the DIOS to his official residence, allegedly to force him to forget about whatever happened in the meeting. But by that time, someone had posted the video of the incident shot on a mobile phone to the WhatsApp group of the Education Department officers. Some officers of Gorakhpur, where Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was camping, sought time to register their protest against the incident. Sources said while Adityanath had yet to react to the incident, the rogue lawmaker asked his aide to make a video while he would say sorry to Deo.

BJP's Bairia MLA Surendra Singh is no stranger to controversy. In July 2018, he told reporters, ""Even Lord Ram would not have been able to stop rapes"", when they queried him about the Unnao rape case in which BJP's Bangarmau MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar is an accused

An Education Department officer alleged that many teachers who stay in cities don't attend the schools in villages.""They grease the palm of local representatives in return for security of their jobs. Such people would obviously dislike any officer who would proactively try to make them go by the book"", alleged the officer, who didn't want to be named.

Playing down the seriousness of the incident, the DM said, ""Nothing had happened between the MLA and the DIOS.""

Surendra Singh is no stranger to controversy. In April 2018, he infamously said a public rally in Ballia that the next Lok Sabha elections were going to be Islam versus God.

"5510","","MUMBAI: The concept of School Management Committee (SMC), which is being carried out in rural schools of Maharashtra, may soon be implemented in city schools too.

Currently, instead of SMC, city schools have Parents Teachers Associations (PTA), which aims at building good relations between teachers/management and parents for the benefit of students. Yet parents seem dissatisfied with the major decisions taken by schools.

Meanwhile, the state education department is getting a good response from parents and schools in Zilla Parishad and other taluka-level in the state.

Some of the highlights of SMC in rural schools include, 'A day at school', where parents along with grandparents and siblings spend the entire day at school with teachers, headmistress and the student.

There is also the 'Personalised mid-day meal', which is created by teachers and parents together as per the ingredients schools receive for the mid-day meal every month.

""By mixing, matching and twisting the ingredients, a new dish is created once or twice a week to charge the students,"" a teacher from the Nashik district school said.

'HM-Parents brainstorming' is another innovative programme under the SMC which helps both the stakeholders to understand students' requirements in order to increase productivity.

SMC and PTA both functions equally however a major difference is the level of involvement.

Prachi Sathe, officer on special duty of state government explained, ""PTA is limited to open houses, fee hike discussions, etc. While with SMC, a student is discussed in and out by the teacher and the parents. This way, both of them know what is to be done to help the student do better in every way.

International Business is undergoing a paramount transformation with the arrival of new technologies, shrinking boundaries, and the growing cosmopolitan culture. The Indian market itself has become a thriving ground for international talent and with the growing entrepreneurship in the Indian Subcontinent, the global demand for cutting-edge business solutions and inventive minds is on the rise.

Among the leading Indian B-Schools, FORE School of Management has wholeheartedly embraced the wind of change and has fully committed itself to foster the sharpest minds in the business world with a special focus on the global business climate.

In a brief programme spanning almost a week, IIP focused on providing students the international exposure and a platform for exchanging ideas and practices through streamlined lectures by the major academicians.

The 2018 IIP had 5 highly specialized and cutting-edge courses:

During the 2018 IIP, students visited various companies in Singapore like Grey Orange, Expara, Olam, and DHL as an essential part of their academic program. Technology group students also relished the first-hand experience of 3D printing at 3D Printing Lab of NTU.

"5517","","Historian writes to Culture Secretary seeking conservation of heritage building

Despite experts from the National Institute of Technology-Calicut (NIT-C) expressing willingness to conduct a technical study on the colonial era building on the premises of St. Joseph's Anglo-Indian Girls Higher Secondary School, the management continues to maintain its opposition to the Culture Department's bid to declare it as a protected monument.

According to sources, the proposal for the study was put forward during the course of informal talks between representatives of the management, a group of old students who are batting for the protection of the building, and heritage enthusiasts.

The effort was to find out the feasibility of retaining the building and examine the architectural parameters involved. However, the management is learnt to have backtracked on the proposal.

Meanwhile, historian M.G.S. Narayanan has written to V. Venu, Secretary, Department of Culture, pointing out the need to conserve the few heritage structures remaining in Kozhikode town. Mr. Narayanan said that though Kozhikode could boast a rich heritage, its symbols such as the Hajoor Kacheri, had been demolished.

""It is painful to know that there is a plan to demolish the historically important building connected to Mother Veronica. A native of France, she has a unique place in the history of Kozhikode as the one who set up the first school for girls in Malabar in the 19th century, when education was a dream for the female population,"" he said in the letter.

The century-old structure reflecting the grandeur of colonial architecture has a pride of place in Kozhikode. ""At a time when modern technology is being used to conserve such buildings, efforts to bring it down in the name of security are condemnable,"" Mr. Narayanan said.

Congratulating the Culture Department for proposing to declare it as a protected monument, the historian said that the demolition of the building would be a blot on the image of the Apostolic Carmel, who have rendered yeomen service to society for over a century.

Sources close to the management told The Hindu on Monday that at a time when many age-old government schools were being demolished to make way for new buildings with advanced facilities, there was no point in retaining the structure there.

The management was not taken into confidence before the Culture Department issued the gazette notification proposing to declare the building as a protected monument.

The regional town planner had submitted a report ruling out the antiquity of the building and it was not 100 years old too.

""We have filed an appeal against the Culture Department's gazette notification.

A recent governing council meeting with Higher Education Minister G T Devegowda discussed the changes. Highly placed sources said, ""Some members suggested to change the name. Change means not the complete revision of name, they suggested to make it economics and management."" However, other members opposed by saying that the focus of the institute is economics and including management will not serve any great purpose.

Even the registration process for the institute has become a problem as it is registered under two entities. One under the Societies Act as an education trust and another under the Universities Act.

"5525","","New Delhi: The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has proposed to rename its newest School of Management and Entrepreneurship after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who passed away on August 16.

The decision, taken by the university's executive council, comes amid a renaming spree where the Centre and several state governments have decided to dedicate projects to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stalwart.

While the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Yogi Adityanath, has decided to name the proposed Bundelkhand Expressway as 'Atal Path', Chhattisgarh's upcoming capital Naya Raipur will be known as Atal Nagar.

A 'ghat' on the Sabarmati River in Gujarat, the AIIMS Rishikesh auditorium and the cyber tower in Mauritius, which was set up with Vajpayee's help, will also be named after him.

Apart from these, several states have requested the Centre to allow them to rename landmarks after Vajpayee. These include proposals from Andhra Pradesh to name AIIMS Mangalagiri after the former PM, one from Himachal Pradesh to rename the Rohtang Tunnel, another from Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to change the name of the Habibganj railway station and a personal request from an Assam BJP legislator to call the Bogibeel Bridge on Brahmaputra river 'Atal Setu'.

The former prime minister's ashes were also immersed in rivers across the country, from the Gomti in Lucknow to Imphal river in Manipur, with several BJP leaders leading the processions in the states.

While the governments are of the opinion that renaming institutions, roads and welfare schemes after Vajpayee would be a fitting tribute to a man considered an astute politician and a master negotiator, not everyone is happy with the developments.

Almost a week after the former prime minister's death, his niece Karuna Shukla on Thursday raked up a controversy by alleging that the BJP was politicising Vajpayee's demise for electoral gains in the 2019 polls.

""The BJP is selfish and doing politics in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Using his name, they are prepping for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls,"" Shukla said in an interview to News18.

She alleged that the saffron party profited from Vajpayee's name during his lifetime and was using his name after his death for political gains. ""The BJP is not at all ashamed over politicising his death,"" said Shukla, a former Lok Sabha MP who was denied a ticket by the BJP in 2014 and later resigned from the party.

The Congress, too, accused the BJP of trying to gain political mileage out of Vajpayee's death. ""The last rites are performed by family members for peace of the departed soul,"" the party tweeted. ""PM Modi and the BJP have usurped the last remains of Former PM Vajpayee and are using it for petty political gains. BJP leaders discover new lows everyday,"" Congress said on its official Twitter handle.

Vajpayee, one of India's tallest leaders and the first non-Congress Prime Minister to complete a full term in power by leading a tenuous coalition with his inclusive politics and superlative oratory, died on August 16 after a prolonged illness. He was 93.","JNU's School of Management Added to Long List of Things to be Renamed After Vajpayee","930704965","2018-08-23","https://www.news18.com/news/india/jnus-school-of-management-added-to-long-list-of-things-to-be-renamed-after-vajpayee-1854893.html","News18",FALSE

MUMBAI, July 18, 2018/PRNewswire/ -- The cohort that graduated in May this year, recorded a 3-fold jump in starting salaries - from INR 8 lakhs (pre-MBA) to INR 25 lakhs on completing the program.

Dubai, Mumbai, Singapore and Sydney-based SP Jain School of Global Management (SP Jain Global) announced today the ongoing successful campus placements for its flagship Global MBA program.

The highest offer this year was made at INR 41 lakhs.

Dr. Balakrishna Grandhi, Dean of the School's Postgraduate Programs attributes this success to the School's unique tri-city educational model that has proven to transform its students from aspiring business managers to 21st century global business leaders.

Speaking of the skills he developed through the School's tri-city exposure, he shares, ""The Global MBA program helped me develop the specific global skills and competencies modern companies, like Google, focus on. Not only did I graduate with a first-hand understanding of how businesses operate in different parts of the world, the cultural immersion I underwent in each of the three cities went a long way in shaping my interviews at Google. For instance, my final interviewer was based in Sydney and I was able to connect with him instantly. We spent the first 15 minutes of my interview bonding over our Sydney experiences and discussing how progressive the city is when compared to the rest of the world. The fact that I was able to engage someone sitting in another corner of the world really helped me make an impact."" At Google, he manages multi-million-dollar campaigns for a US-based Fortune 500 company.

"5530","","A day after the police arrested a 42-year-old life guard for allegedly raping a three-and-a-half-year-old girl inside the premises of a Greater Noida-based private school, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar initiated a probe against the school's management.

A committee, led by the additional district magistrate and comprising of chief medical officer, district inspector of schools, chief fire officer and additional regional transport officer of Gautam Budh Nagar, will probe whether the private school had flouted the safety norms issued by the Central Board Of Secondary Education (CBSE).

The committee will submit its report within 15 days, after which the district administration will initiate action based on the findings.

The probe will include inspection of school buses, fire safety system, background check of staff, food quality and hygiene.

""After reading various media reports claiming alleged rape of a girl student in a private school, we have set up a committee to probe whether the school management had all security measures in place and followed the security guidelines issued by the affiliating board. The committee will also probe whether the school's management had installed sufficient close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in working condition in all areas. The five-member committee will submit its report along with its suggestions in 15 days,"" GB Nagar district magistrate BN Singh said.

The magistrate has also called for a meeting of principals/heads of all private schools of Greater Noida and Noida on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. ""In light of recent incident, we have called a meeting of all principals of Greater Noida schools on Tuesday and Noida schools on Thursday. We will also meet the parents of the victim child,"" Singh said.

The incident took place on Thursday morning when the child, who is enrolled in nursery, complained of acute pain in her abdomen and private parts after returning home after swimming classes in school. When her parents took her to a hospital in Delhi, a medico legal test showed that the child had suffered injuries in her private part. The parents took the child to school on Friday and asked her to identify the man who had hurt her. The child pointed at Chandi Das, a 42-year-old life guard at the school, after which he was arrested at his residence in Greater Noida on Saturday. The accused has denied charges.

The school's management refused to answer any queries regarding the district administration's decision to set up a probe against it on Sunday despite repeated calls and messages.

Earlier on Saturday, the school management issued a statement in defence of the life guard, stating that the CCTV footage does not show anything conclusive to suggest rape, and that the child ""was in good health"".

On Sunday, police said that the CCTV footage provided by the school management shows the child swimming in the pool in the presence of the life guard. Then the video shows kids lining up after the class and heading towards the washroom through the corridor. ""There was no CCTV in the corridor or near the washroom, making them the grey areas. The accused has been sent to jail,"" Surajpur station house officer Manoj Kumar Pant said.

The child's father claimed that his wife had spoken to their daughter's class teacher about her feeling uneasy during the swimming class. ""Prior to this incident, my wife and daughter's class teacher also had a WhatsApp conversation in which she was informed her that my daughter feels nervous during the swimming class,"" the victim's father said.","Probe ordered against management of Greater Noida school in minor's rape case","906499780","2018-07-16","https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/probe-ordered-against-management-of-greater-noida-school-in-minor-s-rape-case/story-0viYbW97P1WbxXrWLk62IP.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"5533","","A water audit held at the Government Girls' Higher Secondary School, Ernakulam, has suggested a slew of water management measures including proper rainwater harvesting and recycling of waste water to reduce consumption and improve water use efficiency.

The audit was carried out by SCMS Water Institute, SCMS School of Engineering and Technology, Karukutty.

It was found that two tanks of approximately 40,000 litre capacity, located on the campus for rainwater harvesting, were not effectively used. The huge quantity of rainwater harvested from rooftop areas of buildings were not stored but discharged. There was no provision for waste water management including recycling and reuse of water. The waste water from wash basins and kitchen was discharged into drains as there was no system for its treatment and reuse, according to the audit report.

Water use

The school, one of the oldest public education institutions in the city, has an average daily water demand of 22,500 litres. The Kochi Corporation incurs a monthly expense of ₹25,000 towards water bill for the school as a major share of the water needs of the educational institution is met by the water supplied by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA). The institution imparts education to around 1,700 students from nursery to higher secondary classes.

The KWA meets 49% of the demand for water at the school and the rest is taken care of by the water from five borewells. Bacterial contamination was observed in two borewells on the campus. All other water quality parameters were found within permissible limits. The borewell near the north of the high school building was found subjected to saline intrusion. No cases of water-borne diseases were reported from the school in the last five years, according to the audit report.

In order to improve the overall standard of education and functioning of the 31 ashramshalas (residential schools for tribals), the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP), Ghodegaon, has introduced a special programme to strengthen the School Management Committees (SMCs). Ayush Prasad, project director, ITDP Ghodegaon, said the SMCs will ensure that schools undertake steps towards improvement of the quality of education.

SMCs are statutory bodies constituted under the Right to Education Act, 2009, which have to ensure the effective functioning of the schools, and welfare of the children. SMCs are expected to solve the local problems schools face.

SMCs play an important role in improving the quality of education at government-run schools in the National Capital Region (NCR). Members of the SMCs are usually the parents, people's representatives, educationists, members of self-help groups, etc.

""We have been working towards strengthening the SMCs and increasing their participation. We are motivating and training them,"" said Prasad.

Capacity-building exercises will be conducted for SMCs, which will cover three fronts -- functions, functionaries and funds. Prasad said functions of the SMCs are defined in the Right To Education Act and various government resolutions. ""It is important that SMC members have a good educational background. We have allocated Rs 5 lakh per SMC, apart from a corpus of nearly Rs 3 crore at ITDP, which schools can use, if there is a shortage of funds,"" he added.

The SMCs have been asked to prepare a development plan to use the unspent corpus, and make fresh demands. Only work that benefits students will be taken up, said Prasad.

""The purchases will be effected by September and new constructions, if any, will be undertaken between October and December,"" he added.

In order to ensure that SMC meetings are held regularly, it has been suggested that committees in each school conduct a meeting on the 25th of every month.

Also, a calendar listing nearly 200 progarmmes has been drawn up to help students express themselves beyond academics.

Prasad said this would be the first time such a capacity-building exercise was taken up at government schools.","ITDP Ghodegaon to strengthen school management committees","879894288","2018-06-03","http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/itdp-ghodegaon-to-strengthen-school-management-committees-5201950/","The Indian Express",FALSE

"5545","","Networking opportunities, job offers, French classes, and lively debates -- all part of a short MBA exchange programme

IÉSEG School of Management, France, is a prestigious institution which impart quality education in management, specifically, in international business. IÉSEG has triple accreditation from EQUIS, AMBA and AACSB, and has two campuses: one at Lille and another in Paris.

I was at the Lille campus, the oldest of the two, as part of the student exchange programme sponsored by my home university, Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, New Delhi, to pursue the third trimester of my MBA. I was also selected to the Grande École programme here. IÉSEG belongs to the Conférence des Grandes Écoles (CGE), a French national institution, established in 1973. Conditions of entry to the CGE are strict, and the member institutions and the degrees they award are highly regarded by academia and the industry alike. It was a tremendous experience, where I got to meet budding professionals from universities in Australia, Canada Argentina, and Korea. There is also a huge community of Indian students from various institutes such as the IIMs, XLRI, SP Jain, NMIMS, and more, making it hard to feel homesick.

Pedagogic style

The skill imparting techniques used at the school were unique. There were several world-renowned faculty, including French diplomats and persons of eminence in public service, with proven ability in the field of management. The course content and syllabus were also different. Critical management problems are formed as subjects. Knowledge was imparted intensively through group work, presentation, debate and continuous assessment. Our deliberations involved many case studies from current problems happening in the world.

In between, there were also discussions about business challenges and opportunities in various countries. In this era of globalised business, the networking opportunities given to the students of this programme is a tremendous advantage. IÉSEG offers many courses in management for international students, in French and English. Knowledge in French is an advantage, but not a must. Non-French-speaking students have separate classes for French. IÉSEG offers various graduate, post-graduate and Ph.D. programmes.

In partnership with IÉSEG's Alumni Network, the school organises meetings throughout the year between its students and professionals from across business sectors. The campus recruitment team holds career fairs where students are offered internships (6 months), gap years (césures), apprenticeship contracts, consulting projects or job offers from major brands.

Lille, the scenic city, is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region in northern France. A cultural hub and bustling university city today, it was once an important merchant centre of French Flanders, and many Flemish influences still remain. Being well connected with the Eurail system, the whole of Europe is truly just a train ride away.

""They are human beings and need time to implement the measures suggested by us. The assurance has come from the top authority in the school and we trust them,"" said a representative of the parents after meeting the school principal and other senior members on Saturday afternoon.

On Saturday, a group of parents reached the school around 10am and contrary to expectations of another round of protests, they agreed to hold talks with the school. The principal reciprocated by assuring them to make all amends to prevent a rerun of Friday's incident.

""Co-operate with us. We have a history of a long-standing relationship based on trust. There may have been some issues but we are doing our best to make the changes. Some of the parents today were students of this school,"" said the principal.

The representatives of the guardians urged other parents to send their children to school. ""Everything is normal. Please send your child to school on Monday. Do not believe rumours that school has been shut down. The parents have to take

the initiative to restore normalcy,"" said another guardian.

Many educationists termed it as a positive development and felt it will not only help the school and the parents to work in tandem to ensure kids' safety but also save the students from terrorising images of protesting parents and the police on a warpath.

""The parents and the school have displayed exemplary maturity in dealing with the situation on Saturday,"" said Marcus Fernandes, a former vice-principal.

""The statement by the principal suggests that the school authorities have accepted that there were some loopholes and they are willing to make amends. The response from the parents is an indicator of the fact that instead of indulging in a slugfest they want to co-operate with the school for the sake of their children. This should be an example for all parents and schools.""

Many parents also appeared worried by what was happening outside the school. Several organisations reached the school and tried to become a stakeholder in the protest. Many of them distributed pamphlets and put posters on the walls. ""We request all not to stick posters on the school's wall.

It Many organisations have been coming here to protest. They are within their rights to do so but please do not dirty the walls. Our daughters study here and we want a good atmosphere for them,"" said a parent. Another parent requested not to politicise the matter. Since Friday evening, several political parties and organisations have been agitating in front of the school and Tollygunge police station.","Kolkata school molestation: Guardians, management agree on steps for kids' safety - Times of India","810760071","2018-02-11","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/kolkata-school-molestation-guardians-management-agree-on-steps-for-kids-safety/articleshow/62868676.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"5551","","A day after a Class-12 student allegedly shot dead his school principal in her office in Yamunanagar on Saturday, conflicting accounts about the 18-year-old have emerged, with the school management calling him a spoilt brat while his neighbours vouching for his sincerity and good manners.

The boy was arrested after he allegedly pumped four bullets on the face and chest of Ritu Chhabra (46), principal of Swami Vivekananda Public School, with his father's licensed .32 bore revolver.

Police said he went to the school during a parent-teacher meeting (PTM) around 10.30am and forced his way into Chhabra's office to teach her a lesson as she used to punish him in front of his fellow students over his poor academic performance and low attendance.

Chhabra succumbed to bullet injuries at a private hospital.

The boy, who turned 18 on January 10, has been charged with murder. His father, a financier, is a resident of Yamunanagar town's Hamida locality.

Yamunanagar superintendent of police (SP) Rajesh Kalia said the boy was not good in his studies.

The police on Sunday produced the boy and his father in the district court. While the student was sent to two-day police remand, his father, who was booked under the Arms Act, was sent to two-day police custody.

The news of the boy killing his principal has left his friends and neighbours shocked.

""No doubt, he was a pampered son of a businessman, but he was affable and polite. There might be something that drove him to take this extreme step,"" said one of the family's neighbours.

""How could he murder his principal? It is unbelievable and shocking,"" said Ravi Kumar, a neighbour. ""He is a very good boy and always greeted his elders by touching their feet. He used to go to the temple everyday,"" said Vikram Pandit, another neighbour.

Kamal Kamboj, president of Swami Vivekanand Society that runs the school, said, ""There were some issues with this boy. First, he used to come on a Bullet (Royal Enfield) bike against school rules and he was scolded for this. Another was about his low attendance and also he never took his teachers and studies seriously.""

Kamboj said, ""Our staff said he never cared what the teachers would say. He was a pampered son of a rich man.""

A school staff member said, ""The principal had also warned him against bringing mobile phone to the school.""

School principal cremated

The body of school principal Ritu Chhabra was cremated by her family members on Sunday morning. Her husband Rajesh Chhabra said the incident has shaken his family, especially his sons. The family members said Ritu was teaching economics in the school for the past 17 years and was promoted as principal in June 2014.

"5554","","A private school in Mumbai's Charkop area, which has been given authority by MHADA to maintain an open ground, has insisted that visitors either provide their Aadhaar card or a police no objection certificate (NOC) before entering, Mumbai Mirror reported on Tuesday.

According to the report, MMRDA gave the 30,000 square foot ground on lease to Vidya Shikshak Prasarak Mandal Trust that runs Akshara High School. The school is located right in front of the ground.

Interestingly, the trust is run by former Maharashtra agriculture minister Ranjeet Deshmukh, and his son Ashish, who is a BJP MLA from Katol.

However, according to the Bombay High Court, general public can access Mumbai's open spaces between 5.30 am and 7.30 am, and then in the evening between 5 pm and 7 pm. Denying people entry during these times can attract prosecution, as per the law.

In 2017, DNA had reported that while on paper, the BMC will release 216 open spaces to NGOs and citizen groups, in reality most of these spaces are controlled by netas.

If we calculated the cost of these open spaces that measure up to 250 acres, it runs into thousands of crores of rupees as they exist at prime locations across the city.

According to Garden department of BMC, there are around 1,068 open spaces available with the civic body which are spread over 1,200 acres and these are spread across the city, western and the eastern suburbs. The civic administration claims that out of 1,068 open spaces, only 216 open spaces will be given to citizen groups, NGOs and private organisations to maintain. And, the civic administration will ensure that the garden should not be used for other purposes. However, activists and a few corporators believe that the civic administration will give away all these plots gradually.","Mumbai: No entry without Aadhaar or police NOC, says school trust maintaining public garden","998631723","2018-11-20","https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-mumbai-no-entry-without-aadhaar-or-police-noc-says-school-trust-maintaining-public-garden-2687423","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE

The city-based boarding school where a 16-year-old student was allegedly gang-raped is all set to lose its no-objection certificate from the state education department as well as its affiliation from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, secretary school education, said: ""I have written a strongly worded letter to the CBSE emphasising that the school's affiliation be cancelled immediately. The NOC from the education department will also be withdrawn. This matter cannot be taken lightly,"" she said.

Withdrawal of NOC by the education department is necessary for the cancellation of affiliation with the respective board. Aulakh said they will make arrangements to admit the rest of the students in other nearby schools.

The incident was exposed on September 16 and district education officers conducted a raid in the school on September 18, after which the chief education officer (CEO) Dehradun district recommended the cancellation of affiliation and NOC on the basis of poor security steps in the school.

There are 357 students in the school that is registered as a day and boarding facility where 33 senior boys, 8 senior girls and 12 junior girls were staying in hostels.

The report said the school did not have CCTVs at the main gate, school or hostels.

The regional CBSE office had earlier served five notices to the school to improve the security arrangements but the school did not pay heed. The office served a show-cause notice to the school on Monday, demanding explanation on why it had not made proper security arrangements, after a case was registered regarding the gang rape of a student.

Acknowledging the need for regular monitoring of private schools, Aulakh said, ""It is very important to regularly monitor private schools so that such incidents do not take place. The Supreme Court has made guidelines for the safety of children in schools. Next week, we will begin work on a mechanism to ensure these schools are regularly monitored by officials.

"5557","","By Sukhada Khandge

writes to state govt, recommending withdrawal of this key document, after scores of parents complain that the makes impossible demands during admissions, such as submission of birth certs in English, ration cards only on specific names, and more

After years of complaints by parents of students applying for admission to The Bishop's School in Camp, claiming that the latter insists on the submission of birth certificates only in the English language, the possibility of repercussions is in the offing. Now, the education officer has finally suggested the withdrawal of the school's no-objection certificate () to the state government, in a letter issued by the Zilla Parishad education office.

Over the years, complaints have come from parents about various rules imposed by the school during admissions, despite regular warnings from the education officer. For instance, while birth certificates are usually accepted in the local language of the state, parents claimed they were inconvenienced by the school's insistence on this document being in English.

One such parent, who was vying for his son's admission here, shared on condition of anonymity, ""I was forced to knock on the doors of a different school at the last moment as Bishop's did not accept my child's birth certificate in Marathi. We tried to get it in English, but this was not possible. We complained about this to the education officer, so that the school does not continue with such rules in future.""

Many such plaints from parents poured in before a committee was set up during this academic year to make inquiries. The latest letter sent by the education officer confirms that the school denied giving any clarifications about its demand, citing only that it can do so because it is a minority school. The missive further states that the school has submitted no documentary evidence of its minority status. Considering all this, ZP (primary) education officer Sunil Kurhade suggested revoking the school's NOC.

""I have issued a letter to the deputy secretary of the state education department in this regard. There have been many complaints from parents during the admission period over the last two years,"" Kurhade confirmed to Mirror, adding that the basic inquiry report cleared that the school has submitted no clarifications or documents demanded by the authorities.

Many had also complained that the school pressured them to submit ration cards bearing the names of either the parents or students; cards on the names of grandparents or other kin are rejected. The official inquiry report also mentions that the school principal has been accused of never attending any meetings with parents, and always sending non-teaching staffers for the same.

All this, said officials, amounts to not following rules laid out in the NOC and permission letter given to the school -- and therefore, these may as well be revoked.

The letter was sent out by the education office in the face of mounting pressure, soon after the (MNS) students' union also demanded action on the school.

WhenMirror quizzed school authorities about this uproar, Bishop's spokesperson Markas Deshmukh said, ""We ask for translations of birth certificates submitted in the regional language because we want the correct spelling of the student while entering it into the register. What has happened now is a politically motivated complaint. We have not received any letter from the education office till date.""","'Revoke Bishop's School NOC'","941173690","2018-09-07","https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/pune/civic/revoke-bishops-school-noc/articleshow/65712067.cms","Pune Mirror",FALSE

It is the presence of traffic marshals in front of the school, which has kept its buses, taxis and other vehicles moving. The school has a compound to accommodate parents who come to pick their children, so they need not wait on the road. Parents are happy that they are allowed to park their two-wheelers near the school while they pick up or drop their kids. Many prefer to take public transport such as BEST buses or trains. However the parking of the buses on an arterial road during the school leaving hours adds to woes of commuters.

Due to the presence of traffic personnel around the school, four wheelers are not allowed to stop in front of its gate, which is exactly at the turn towards Dadar station. As the spot is always busy since it is a market area, there is hardly any space to walk.

There are several popular locations in and around Dadar that pull in the crowds such as the Siddhivinayak temple; the proximity of the school to the station also keeps the area near it busy.

Due to the absence of the traffic police at the junction, motorists and the bus drivers can be seen stopping traffic even when the traffic lights are green.

Barring the safety factor of the students who cross the road on their own, a majority of the parents who come to pick up their children have a scooter and tend to park right in front of the gate. Most of the parents don't stop for longer than a minute, but multiple scooters lined up waiting outside the gate results in a massive traffic congestion on the busy road.

An illegally operating auto crammed with schoolchildren are a common sight in front of the school gate

PrincipalSpeak

Principal Anna Correa said, ""At the beginning of the year, we had set up a traffic committee, mostly made up of willing parents and some teachers. Parent volunteers come in the morning, at the lunch break and after school to help at the gate. Along with the school, they have worked out a way to reduce congestion problems. For instance, no parking is allowed at the main gate and vehicles have to be parked either before or after the gate. The senior boys enter through gate number 3 and the younger ones use gate number 1. Our disadvantage is that our main gate is common for both St Peter's Church and the school. It is not possible for us to control people from coming in for church services. While the traffic department agreed to send two officers to help, they only send one in the morning as they are understaffed.""

"5568","","PUNE: The Sinhagad Road police on Friday booked certain individuals for abetting the suicide of the headmaster of a school at Donje village, near the foothills of the Sinhagad fort,

The suspects are the parents of some Class IX students of the same school.

Ashok Kaware, the 57-year-old headmaster, had ended his life by jumping into the canal waters at Vadgaon Budruk, off Sinhagad Road, on September 26. He had reportedly taken the extreme step after being humiliated by the parents and students -- they had beaten and abused Kaware for punishing some students at the school.

Varsha Ashok Kaware, the headmaster's wife, had lodged a complaint with the police after the incident.

According to the First Information Report (FIR), on September 24, Kaware had punished five students for mischief at school. When the students complained to their parents, they rushed to the school to confront the headmaster. They then hurled abuses at Kaware and even beat him up.

The parents had also threatened Ashok Kaware with dire consequences, said assistant inspector Jyoti Gadkari, who currently investigating the case.

The news of the incident soon spread in the village and adjacent hamlets.

This left Kaware traumatised and perturbed.

""He was very disturbed. He had sustained a mental trauma,"" Varsha said in her police complaint.

The complainant told police that her husband was innocent and had served the school honestly for many years. Kaware's retirement was approaching and the incident had left him shocked, the police officials said.

Dejected, Kaware ended his life by jumping into the canal water, his wife said.

According to the police, the man who first attacked Kaware on the school premises is a local political leader. He has represented the village at the Zilla Parishad and in the gram panchayat level.

When TOI contacted a few local residents of Donje village on Saturday, they were all praise for Kaware. They said he was a good teacher and a good man.","Pune: School headmaster ends life after students' parents beat him up - Times of India","1019544915","2018-12-16","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/school-headmaster-ends-life-after-students-parents-beat-him-up/articleshow/67110367.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"5569","","The parents of a pair of twins studying at the Saraswati Mandir Education Society (SMES) school have alleged that their children are being denied the Measles and Rubella (MR) vaccine in the school in order to avenge a case that the parents had filed against the school. The parents had earlier filed a case against the school with the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (MSCPCR) against their alleged illegalities.

The school is issuing consent forms to be filled by parents to seek their approval for the vaccination but has not given the same to the twins. One of the grieving parents of the two children studying in class 3 said, ""Despite the case still pending in the MSCPCR, the school has declared that my children are not bona fide students of the school and did not give them any stationary, identity cards, calendar of the school etc, which is a violation of child rights. A few days ago, the school gave consent forms to all the children but did not give the same to my children. They were told by their class teacher that they will not be given MR vaccination. I am wondering if MR vaccination is a government scheme or the school's personal scheme.""

According to the parent, the school was pulled up by the Child Rights Commission for charging advance fees, making their children sit in a separate classroom for not having paid the fees, telling them that PTA is illegal etc. Despite this, the school this year sent a letter to the parents that their children are not bona fide students of the school and will not be allowed to participate in any school activities like sports day, annual day etc. The kids are only allowed to attend the school and sit for examination, the parent said.

Siddharth Sharma, advocate for the parents, said, ""The school has challenged MSCPCR recommendation by filing a writ petition in Bombay High Court. But there is no stay order on child rights recommendation to school. Despite all recommendations to school in favour of parents, the school is continuing to harass children by denying them their rights and now by denying them MR vaccination. We will send a notice to the BMC education department to be present to ensure these children are also given vaccination or else we will file a case against the BMC and the matter will also be presented in front of the Child Rights Commission.""

"5572","","RANCHI: Facing criticism for the decision to merge schools, the Jharkhand government has now decided to seek consent from parents before merging a primary school with a nearby larger school located beyond a distance of 1 km.According to Principal Secretary of School Education and Literacy Department AP Singh, primary schools will be merged only if parents and the school managing committee are willing. ""Children studying in primary schools will be shifted to larger schools located beyond a distance of 1 km only if the parents of 50 per cent of the students are willing. The consent of the school management committee will also be mandatory,"" said Singh.

He, however, said that there would be no change in primary and secondary schools which have already been merged. Notably, more than 6,000 primary and middle schools have been merged in the past two academic sessions. Around 1,400 have been merged in 2016-7 and 4,600 in 2017-18, while the process of merging 6,466 more middle schools is still on.

Though officials claim that the merger was a part of a ""re-organisation"" process and was being done according to the NITI Aayog guidelines, 12 BJP parliamentarians have objected to it and said the move would lead to the rise in drop-outs.

Speaking about the 2000 schools which are about to be merged, Singh said that the parents would be reimbursed for their travel expenses if they are willing to bring children to schools beyond 1 km.

"5576","","PUNE: Sumit More has taken a 10-day leave from his workplace in California and is currently facing one of the biggest challenges of his life -- finding a school for his 12-year-old daughter here as he's set to shift to the city soon.

Seema Mahesh, who's planning to shift to Pune from Bengaluru next year, is equally busy school hunting here for her daughter in Standard VI in the 2019-20 academic year.

Both More and Mahesh are tense as they are yet to get any concrete response from the institutes about the chances of their wards' admissions for the middle school in the next academic year.

""Admissions at the entry level are easy, but not for the in-between classes. Most schools are not giving us any concrete answer. They don't even entertain our enquiries over the phone. All they tell us to drop an application in the schools and wait,"" said Mahesh, whose daughter is at present studying in a CBSE school in Bengaluru.

Most schools in Pune have started the admission process for the 2019-2020 academic year and put up the forms online. For fresh admissions, the process the parents have to follow is simple. But hassles await parents who are shifting to the city with work, or for some other reasons, and trying to admit their children in the middle schools.

More said, ""I have submitted applications in five schools in the Wakad area. All of them said they would would get in touch with me in April or May. I cannot keep waiting till then hoping that the schools will call me and inform about the vacancies. There needs to be a proper system. There cannot be so much of uncertainties.""

Ravi Varma, another parent, said, ""There should be clear information of vacancies and instructions to the parents. We have been approaching many schools since November for our son's admission to Standard II next year. But we are not getting any confirmation.""

Global Indian International School principal Amrita Vohra said, ""If there is a vacancy and the applicant is from a school affilated to the same board, we try to help the parents in the best possible way. It all depends on the vacancies for a particular year.""

On many occasions, students taking transfer to another school or shifting to another city do not withdraw the leaving certificates. ""Such situations lead to the lack of clarity on the vacancies,"" she said.

City Pride school principal Ashwini Kulkarni said, ""We have started putting up the vacancy information on our school website. We ask the parents to check the site after January 15 for the vacancies, instead of doing the rounds of the school.""

Anubha Sahai, an education activist and parent, said, ""It's difficult to get admission in some schools in both primary and secondary sections because of donations and higher fees for the in-between class cases. They keep parents waiting for months.""

Aam Aadmi Party, Pune, spokesperson Mukund Kirdat said, ""Ensuring an in-between class admission is a challenge for the parents and they keep on visiting the schools between December and March just to find out the vacancy positions.""

"5577","","For the past nine days, Gungun Prajapati's health has been in bad shape. Parents of Prajapati, who is a class five student in Gurunanak National High School, Sion, have alleged that their daughter fell ill from the Measles and Rubella (MR) vaccination provided by the government at her school. Prajapati is currently hospitalised and is being observed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Government health officials have refuted such allegations and have said the girl was already infected before being vaccinated. According to them, the fact that Prajapati fell ill after being vaccinated is only a coincidence. However, the situation has put school authorities in a fix as parents are no more consenting to vaccines.

The vaccinations were monitored at the Gurunanak National High School on November 29. Prajapati's sister, who is a class seven student in the same school, also received the MR vaccine on that day.

Prajapati's father, Tarkeshwar Prajapati, said, ""After receiving the vaccine my daughter complained of nausea and headache. She was also running a temperature. Since then, she has been under medication and on Sunday, we shifted her to the Sion hospital. Presently, she is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with pneumonia. At the time of the vaccination, she only had a mild cough. As per my knowledge, doctors were given instructions to not administer vaccines to students with a fever or cold and cough. If my daughter had a cough, they should not have vaccinated her.""

Such cases across the state have intimidated parents; they are hesitant to let their children take vaccinations at school.

A parent of another student of the Gurunanak National High School said, ""After reading related reports, I am hesitant to let my children be vaccinated at school. We have been asked to partake in a meeting with the doctors. Let us see what they have to say.""

The principal of the aforementioned school said, ""Most of the parents, though educated have refused to consent to vaccines. We cannot force them. We are organising a meet between parents and government doctors.""

Prashant Redij, secretary of the Mumbai School Principals Association, said, ""Eighty per cent schools have been successful in administering vaccines to their students. Only 15 to 20 per cent parents are doubtful. I think if parents want their children to be vaccinated by family doctors, the government should also direct these doctors to vaccinate children to make the project a success.""

Dr Santosh Revankar, Joint Executive Health Officer, BMC, said, ""Prajapati's case has nothing to do with the vaccine. It is only coincidence that she fell ill after being vaccinated. If the vaccine had to react, it would have reacted immediately; within an hour or so. Her nausea is due to the fear of vaccines.""

"5579","","The Mount Carmel School in Dwarka which has been issued a de-recognition notice by the Delhi government over arbitrary fee hike said Friday that it would come out clean and urged students and their parents to not panic.

""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean,"" Michael Williams, the director of Mount Carmel School told PTI.

""Once we receive the notice, we will take the appropriate legal remedy and we have full faith in the legal system,"" he added.

Keeping the students' interest in mind, the withdrawal of recognition would take effect on April 1, 2019, the order said, adding that no new admissions should be made in the meantime.

The school had argued that it had not been given land by the Delhi Development Authority on concessional rates, so the Delhi High Court judgment that gives the DoE the power to regulate fees of such schools was not applicable to it, the order said.

The DoE, however, said the March 9, 2000 allotment letter for the land given to the school showed it had been given the property at a concessional rate.

"5588","","Founded earlier this year, SchoolHandy helps parents stay in the loop by providing a host of services like emergency alerts and real-time updates of their children's activities in school.

Do you remember when getting an education was a simpler task? Go to school, study, write exams and move on to next class. While that may be oversimplifying it a bit, one must admit that students, parents and schools have their work cut out for them these days. While the pressure on students to perform, excel and succeed has been steadily increasing, parents too are scrambling to keep track of what is happening in their child's life. And school, where it all happens, not only needs to provide a challenging environment for the child to thrive but also ensure their safety.

Chirag Palande was having dinner with his wife one night when they began talking about an efficient way to be more involved in their daughters' academic progress, and everything else that was happening at school - tests, exams, last dates for fee payment, etc. The result was SchoolHandy.

This Mumbai-based app went live this year after Chirag spent a year-and-a-half doing research.

""We had done a survey to understand what schools need, and spoke to a group of parents as well. In some schools, there was no way to communicate with parents except having them attend PTAs, something which not all parents have the time for. Though some relay info through SMSes, many schools noted that parents don't check them,"" says 37-year-old Chirag.

SchoolHandy takes a stab at solving this communication gap by offering a gamut of services for an ""efficient schooling experience"". It is an end-to-end, cloud-based, parent updating app that covers it all: a child's safety and live school bus tracking, report cards and information dashboards, forums where the school can interact with parents, and a chat platform to get queries quickly answered.

Chirag notes that the app helps avoid any gaps in communication between the school and the parents. Take, for example, the live school bus tracking feature. With child safety becoming a growing concern in the country today, this feature helps to ensure the child is safe en route to or from school. This feature can be accessed by both the parents as well as school authorities.

SchoolHandy also provides a one-to-one chat platform and real-time updates on forum discussions between the school and the parents. This way, parents are kept in the loop and receive important notices, notifications and emergency alerts that schools send, which the children may fail to relay.

What's more, you can actually pay your child's school fees through the app too, besides monitoring your children's homework and accessing results after the annual exams. Its radio-frequency identification (RFID) based attendance system eliminates time-consuming roll call systems.

SchoolHandy installs hardware devices with a tracking mechanism in schools, which help record attendance and also alert parents that the kid has entered or left the classroom.

""In essence, with this app, parents will feel more involved while schools will have the relief of relaying vital information to them. The application is very simple to use,"" says Chirag. The app has 7,000 downloads so far on the Play Store.

Chirag has over 18 years of experience in marketing and innovation. He also founded brand 'Mobaccs', which sells VR glasses and remotes. He runs both SchoolHandy and Mobaccs; SchoolHandy is promoted, funded and managed by Mobaccs.

The SchoolHandy app is currently free to use for both schools and parents. The company, however, charges the school for its hardware such as GPS and attendance system and plans to add different features to the app like online shopping, kids insurance, loan for school fees, which will give them revenue in the future.

Around 80 Mumbai schools work with SchoolHandy at the moment. It is also working with four schools in Gujarat and three in Pune. The team of four is also in talks with more schools in Gujarat, Pune, and Hyderabad.

Running after schools and getting them on board was SchoolHandy's major challenge. Chirag says that in areas where these technologies are not that known or heard, this was even more difficult. However, demonstrations helped the team to convince the schools over time. The founder says they are open to customising offerings for the schools based on their needs.

A report by KPMG and Google says that the Indian edtech market will touch $1.96 billion by 2021, with close to 9.6 million users from $247 million and over 1.6 million users in 2016.

There are a few other players in this space like Applane Solutions, School Diary, Falcon, and Educhat.in, each focussed on specific services or offering slightly varied services.

According to Chirag, what gives SchoolHandy an edge over the competition is the fact that all the services are available on one platform.

SchoolHandy aims to cater to at least 100 schools across India by the end of three years, and also plans to add a feature for updates on cultural and other activities conducted in the schools - where photos, videos, can be shared. Creating a solid revenue model is also on the cards for this entrepreneur.

Apart from this, it plans to add a feature, where the books can be delivered at the doorstep with a nominal fee.","This app helps parents track their children's life at school in real-time","1003669589","2018-11-26","https://yourstory.com/2018/11/schoolhandy-app-parents-track-children-school-real-time/","YourStory.com",FALSE
"5589","","HYDERABAD: In yet another case of alleged corporal punishment, parents of students accused Telangana Social Welfare Residential School of girls in Mahindra Hills here of giving stringent punishment to students for trivial issues. They also accused the school teachers of taking away the snacks they send to their children residing in the hostel.

In a complaint to the child's right body Balala Hakkula Sangham (BHS), signed by 31 parents, Usha Rani, parent of a class 9 student said that she never faced any problems in the last five years that her daughter has been studying in the school until this academic year when new teachers were appointed.

''The teachers make our girls walk on stairs on their knees, make them kneel down, hit and bang them against the wall and also fine them for being late to school,"" Usha alleged. ""I asked the principal to allow me to take my daughter home for two days as it was her birthday but she refused,'' she added. Another parent requesting anonymity alleged that when he tried to raise the issue with the principal she dismissed the matter and thereafter refused to see him.

Worried about their daughters' physical and psychological well-being, several parents like Usha now want to withdraw their children from the school. ""The principal, however, told me that I cannot pull out my daughter from the school as and when I want. She said she will take one week to process my complaint and decide. But what if my stressed-out daughter takes an extreme step? Will the society and principal take responsibility? Usha questioned.

"5590","","Why Australian PM's apology to victims of child sexual abuse matters

A toxic combination of poverty, poorly-paid teachers with anti-migrant prejudice and a lack of training on nonviolent discipline in government schools means marginalised children are significantly more likely to experience corporal punishment, said a new study.

Corporal punishment is a form of violence against children and is illegal in India.

Yet 80% of marginalised children report being punished by teachers, while an average of 43% said they were regularly beaten, up to three times a week, according to a new report by Agrasar, an NGO. In some schools the number of regularly beaten students rose to 88%.

The abuse does not end along with the school day. The majority of these children also experienced beatings at home (74%), while a similar proportion of parents admitting to doling out beatings at home (71%).

These are the findings of a survey from a randomised sample of 521 children and 100 parents in Gurugram, an area which experienced a 29% increase in migrant arrivals between 2000 and 2011, largely from poorer states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.

However, ""given that the same mechanisms of economic deprivation and social exclusion are at work, the findings apply to disadvantaged children elsewhere in India"", the report said.

No positive outcomes of corporal punishment have been found, while it is established that physical and mental forms of abuse can have a detrimental effect on child health and wellbeing, including mental-health problems, behavioural issues and cognitive ability, according to the report.

The fear and stress associated with corporal punishment can create ""school-phobia"", leading to increased dropouts, low-retention rates and poor academic scores, significantly impacting on education outcomes, the report said. Children who have experienced such abuse are also more likely to display criminal behaviour, commit violent crimes as adults and suffer from substance abuse.

In 1992, India became one of 128 countries to agree to the United Nations (UN) Convention of Rights of the Child 1989, which outlawed school corporal punishment and required the government under article 28(2) to ensure that ""school discipline is administered in a manner consistent with the child's human dignity"".

The Right to Education Act 2009 further enshrined child safety in schools, stating no child ""shall be subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment"".

Yet, despite such legal protections, recent government studies have found the problem persists. Social structures enforcing the normalcy of corporal punishment remain pervasive in Indian society.

Teachers do not appear to discriminate on the basis of age when it comes to meting out corporal punishment. Both younger and older children alike experienced similarly severe forms of punishment and ""almost on a daily basis"", the report found.

The only difference is that younger children are more likely to experience physical punishment, compared to older children who are more likely to suffer from verbal abuse.

""Physical punishments were given to us when we were young. Now we get mostly verbal punishments, for example we are being ridiculed for our mistakes in front of the class,"" said one girl respondent in the 8th standard.

Marginalised children were found to experience corporal punishment more frequently, with 88% of those surveyed reporting they are regularly beaten at school, up to three times a week. This is ""significantly higher than then average and does not even include verbal abuse"", the report said.

Many children reported verbal and physical abuse on a daily basis, with at least one child reporting he experienced physical punishment ""two times a day minimum"".

As a result, many have become accustomed to such experiences as part of the school routine and fabric of their education experience--71% of children believed it's okay to be beaten up ""for a reason"", having been taught its for ""their own good"" and ""necessary"".

The types of physical and mental punishment distributed by teachers vary in levels of pain, with slapping, ear-pulling, denial of bathroom use and forced periods of standing mentioned as ""not so serious"" punishment forms.

This can increase to more painful types, such as a teacher caning palms and calves, striking the knuckles with a duster or scales and beating backs and heads with their hands, all of which are the ""most common forms of physical punishment"".

Many schools keep a dedicated stick to beat children, the report found.

Cases of brutal punishment, combined with ""psychological torture"", were also narrated by the surveyed children.

Banging students' heads against a wall was turned into ""a game"" by one teacher, with several children recounting that he would often pretend three or four times that he was going to bang the child's head against the wall before actually doing it.

Mental abuse is even more frequently handed out, which for the children of migrant workers in Gurugram often consist of derogatory and racist slurs which many children do not even recognise ""constitute a form of corporal punishment"".

Referencing their low socioeconomic status, these children are labelled as ""Bihari"" or ""Bengali""--denigrating and catch-all terms for any non-locals, regardless of their actual state-of-origin.

These slurs are often followed up with insults such as ""donkey"", ""good for nothing"", ""uneducated"", ""illiterate"" and comments that they had had ""a bad upbringing"", which tend to affect older children the most.

Girl students are subjected to relatively more verbal harassment than boys, often framed in sexist language which instill ""toxic gender stereotypes"". Teachers were found to often resort to comments about their looks, age and weight, ""recommending"" marriage instead of education and minimising their capabilities and skills compared to male peers.

Both male and female teachers were found to mete out corporal punishment in a ""ritualised and uniform way"", with marginal differences in the severity and frequency of punishment they enforced.

While many teachers were found to slap or hit students, some punished students ""with brutal and cruel violence that requires creativity and premeditation"".

Almost all parents (91%) approve of teachers using corporal punishment and use it at home themselves. However, this figure is likely to be higher, as parents tend to not consider ""mild"" forms of physical abuse and verbal harassment as a form of corporal punishment.

Trapped in abusive environments

""A complex mix of social and structural factors perpetuates corporal punishment in our classrooms,"" the report found.

While wealthier, better-educated children are not immune to receiving, disadvantaged children are exposed to a number of influential risk factors which increase their likelihood of experiencing corporal punishment.

Low-income families, living in poor conditions and often with both illiterate parents working long hours in the informal sector, are unable to properly support their children's education.

Absence during the day, followed by exhaustion in the evening, means parent's ""emotional resources"" are largely consumed by their struggle for survival.

Children must manage their own homework and school activities themselves, often in a troubled environment ""characterised by maltreatment and neglect"" brought about by poverty and ""existential"" stress.

Even mothers who were ""homemakers"" in Gurugram were found to interact with their children ""very little"" over school matters. They assumed that the child would bring up any serious issues with her if there were any and relied on elder siblings plus the child's ""own motivation to pursue their studies and education"".

Failure to submit homework, poor test-performance and school absences are major reasons for receiving corporal punishment and which end up hurting children from low socioeconomic backgrounds the most.

Even if they desired, parents are often unable to move their child from the free local government school to another, lacking the financial means to entertain other options.

Migrant children often become the target of ""disdain and contempt"" by teachers who withhold empathy and support. Teachers punish children for their inability to articulate themselves as per the teacher's ""expectations"", as bad language (commonly used at home by both parents and children) and poor language skills enter the classroom.

Periods of absence as migrant children return to their native state for long stretches of time, or even accompany their parents to work, further antagonise teachers, the report said. Upon their return to school, children are unfairly punished for their parents' decision to travel.

Such teacher attitudes are a result of sustained social stigma attached to the less-educated, migrant population, with discrimination against the ""labour class"" rubbing off onto their children.

Teachers feel it is not worthwhile to teach migrant children as ""they will only be cleaning someone's house later anyways"", the report found.

They believe the children are unable to perform well in school and think rationally, as teachers see poverty as ""a genetic predisposition"" which means the children are unworthy of education. They fail to understand that a lack of opportunity and access to resources is why they are struggling with formal education.

The social divide is also keeping parents and teachers from interacting and establishing a working relationship, further impeding the child's education.

Poorly-paid, over-worked and under-resourced teachers operating in sub-par working conditions further adds to the problem, as teachers ""vent out their anger and act aggressively towards students"" and ""rarely show awareness for professional conduct"".

Poor governance, such as a lack of Corporal Punishment Monitoring Cells--set up by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to ensure the ban on corporal punishment is enforced--means unethical teacher conduct is not always properly dealt with, the report said.

The danger is that a toxic combination of all the above-mentioned factors means children are arbitrarily subjected to forms of violence, with no repercussions for teachers already operating with minimal oversight.

Children were found to be punished for ""normal childlike behaviours"" like going to the bathroom, talking in class and during breaks, running around the school yard and fighting with other children.

The cost of corporal punishment

Around 53% of children surveyed never tell their parents if they have been punished at school, undermining a ""trusted relationship"" between parent and child. This also means many children are internalising potentially traumatic experiences, with severe consequences for their mental health and wellbeing, the report found.

Perceiving that learning and corporal punishment ""go hand in hand"", children become desensitised to the violence they see everyday and even lose the ability to identify milder types of physical and mental harassment.

As violence goes unrecognised, resistance builds which in turn can lead to the severity of the violence increasing. Children who experience violence are also more likely to ""become violent perpetrators themselves"".

There is a risk that through the prevalence of corporal punishment, schools are teaching children ""on a large scale that violence is okay"" and is contributing to levels of violence in Indian society at large, the report said.","88% of marginalised children beaten at school; 91% parents okay with it","1000441112","2018-11-22","https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/88-of-marginalised-children-beaten-at-school-91-parents-okay-with-it-118112200092_1.html","Business Standard",FALSE
"5591","","The worth of right education is better than wealth or money. But if education is diverted only for financial benefit, there will be less space for formation of students. Surprisingly, some educational institutions are heading only for financial profit. Profit is priority. Students are secondary. This has placed education upside down. Instead of learning lessons for life, students learn only how to pay fees of different kinds from January to December. Financial burdens are increasing day by day. I say this in regard to post selection exam trauma of Cl. X and Cl. XII students in some schools across Nagaland.

Selection exams for Cl. X and Cl. XII are over in most of the schools in Nagaland. But after exams, there appear various fee collections. I still wonder as to why some schools have to collect money under numerous reasons or agreement with parents. Some of the best examples are Caution/security deposit, Coaching fee, Re-exam fee (if failed in 1/2 subjects), etc. Such collections of money have become normal routine in some schools. Parents accept this illegal routine blindly because it cost the future of their children. Many parents must be paying such amount ranging from rupees 6000 to 10,000 or even more after selection exam. The amount is high enough for many poor parents. Students who passed selection exam pay lesser amount because they are intelligent enough. With-held students are forced to pay more as per the number of failed subjects. In other words, payment is done according to the performance of students. Is this a healthy education? Is money equivalent to intellectual calibre of students? Do students perform better when they are forced to pay money to the School? Do Students pass their examination just because they have paid the said amount to the School? I do not think it so. The Principals and heads of Institutions are free to think otherwise. But it does not suit well under the banner of quality education. Parents are worried about the future of the children, while the school is worried about collection of money for various reasons. Yet, most money collections after selection exam are illegal and unnecessary. Schools must collect only what is necessary (e.g. Board Exam fee). What is not necessary must not be collected. The aim of getting good result need not be substituted by collection of money.

One student said that he has to pay rupees 200 per failed subject to re-write the paper. Another student said that they were asked to pay rupees 50 per subject. All the more, some students were asked to pay rupees 3000 per failed subject with the promise of getting back the amount if they succeed in board exam. This is not true education at all! What if they fail, who takes the money? It is a shame that some educational institutions see failure and success in term of money. If rupees 3000 per student is collected in the name of Coaching fee, multiply the amount according to the number of students in Cl. X and Cl. XII. Rupees 3000×150 students=4,50,000/- only. May be the whole amount is paid to those teachers who take extra classes to maintain good reputation of the school. All the same, students have already paid 12 months tuition fee. I hope there is no 13 month in the yearly calendar of the school.

Caution/security deposits are collected from students (rupees 2000×150 students=300000/- only). If a student absent himself or herself from coaching class, rupees 100/200 per day is deducted from it. Is this not a funny education? I am sure no school pays back the amount with interest after holding the money (7/8 month) till the declaration of result. Deduction takes place, but interest is not paid to students. One side of the coin does not match the other side. Are we heading for 'financial education' or 'education of students'? There is much hollowness in our educational system.

Few points for further reflection:-

If students have paid 12 months tuition fee, do they still have to pay coaching fee?

If they are to pay caution deposit, does the school return the amount with interest after holding the amount for 7/8 months?

Can student pass his/her exam by paying re-exam fee (in case re-exam is held under payment as practiced is some school?)

Is money equivalent to success and failure?

Are we heading for financial education rather than formation of students?

The day to day running of educational institutions are solely under the care and guidance of the principals or heads of institution. All rules and regulations in schools are aimed to discipline and form students in the best possible means. But many schools have numerous untold laws and rules like the above mentioned realities. Let no school become institute of 'educational extortion.' There are better ways of succeeding in life. Education is just one way. There are better means of forming students rather than imposing financial burdens on the weak shoulders of parents and students. The above dirty face of education needs some cleansing for the betterment of students. All schools do not come under this dirty blanket. All the same, what happens in schools and colleges are best known by the Principals, Parents and Students. In the process of aiming for best result, let us not deform young students. Change can best begin in schools. Let us not chain the expected change in our schools.

"5592","","Are tampons safe? How do I tell my family I am gay? How do I put on a condom during sex? Madhavi Jadhavi founded ThatMate, a platform that understands all your questions and aims to address social issues and mental health. All this from Satara, a small town in Maharashtra.

Let's admit it, sex as a topic is still taboo with most Indians. Growing up, how often have you turned to the internet just because your parents found it awkward to discuss sex with you openly? In many households, it is not spoken of at all, despite how important it is to educate one's child on safe sex practices.

How many of your teachers skipped the entire chapter on 'human reproduction' in school because they were embarrassed to talk about it? Or, worse, how many of you were forbidden to talk about periods with boys or loudly in public?

A good education may not necessarily translate into awareness because of the stigma and taboos that exist in Indian society. This is why awareness of social issues and mental health is important at different levels.

Here's where ThatMate steps in. Founded by Madhavi Jadhav, it's a platform that aims to reduce the myths associated with sexual and mental health through engaging tools such as comic books, cartoon characters, workshops, online forums, and counselling.

Madhavi tells me that she's always been a rebel at heart. Raised in a small village in Satara district, Maharashtra, it was not unusual to witness girls getting married once they started menstruating.

""I was working with Shell after completing my education, and during this time, I realised I wanted to work for people rather than a big money-making firm. I decided to quit my job and shift to Satara. I explored many places and realised that there was a dire need for education and awareness among children as well as adults. I reached out to some of my friends and with their help, conducted workshops and seminars for children between the ages of seven and 10 about ""good touch-bad touch"" and safety. The workshop received a wonderful response and this prompted me to start ThatMate,"" she says.

ThatMate aims to bring topics that have been long-considered normal and commonplace in most Western societies.

""One trait that I want to work on is my ability to convince parents, teachers, and other adults to allow me to engage their children on different subjects. We want to encourage dialogue to dispel misnomers, misunderstandings, and ignorant stereotypes that can, at best, cause isolation and further prejudice and, at worst, lead to abuse and even death. However, I do not want to use that fear as a tool to convince adults that our mission is important. I would like to convince them through logic and other means. Fear is not effective, so I need to be able to bring in a constructive, concise dialogue, with the ability to listen and absorb, reformat my tactics and understand how to engage my audience better,"" adds Madhavi.

ThatMate uses a friendly, open, gender-neutral, culturally sensitive approach. It has collaborated with five schools in Satara and will engage with 500 schools in the Sangli district reaching out to approximately 2,00,000 students. It has reached over 13,000 youths through Sarahah (an anonymous social media app) and has conducted 24 Facebook live sessions.

Madhavi has presented ThatMate at platforms like Tedx and LeanIn India. It has also been incubated at Deshpande Foundation, UnLtd India and Atal Incubation Centre, Banasthali, a NITI Aayog initiative.

The startup is bootstrapped with the online platform following a ""freemium"" model.

Madhavi explains, ""Certain services are open to people who have agreed to pay for them. Those that have the free tier will be given advertising to help subsist the costs. This is primarily true for the forum where ads will be offered along with certain videos and services. Our workshops will be on a service model where we will ask for funds directly from the organisation, or through other organisations in the form of sponsors or donors.

Comic book sales are offered at tiered levels depending on the quality of the comics themselves and sponsored outreach. We have special pages for select advertising to reduce the overall cost of the comics to our demographic.""

The response to various programmes has been encouraging. Madhavi shares with us a few quotes from parents and teachers.

""I was abused by my neighbour when I was in the second standard. I didn't know about it until I was a part of the Safe Unsafe touch workshop."" - Student

""I now understand the difference between gender and sex. Also, I used to get scared of transgender people before. After the workshop, I have realised that they are also a part of society and should be treated equally."" - Parent

Madhavi is happy about starting up in a small town. ""The operational costs are lower and the acceptance rate is higher,"" she points out.

ThatMate's future plans include more workshops and partnerships with leading schools in Satara, Solapur, and Kolhapur.

""We will collaborate with NGOs like Tathapi, Stree Shakti Sansthan, Goonj and Enfold. Our immediate need is to raise funds to enable us to objectively achieve our goals. Our long-term goals include establishing a base of operations, hiring a technical team for developing applications, partnering with developers in the gaming and animation sectors, looking for partners in private and government areas, completing our comic book series and offering them in a variety of local languages, and growing our knowledge base with more subject matter experts. We want to reach out and change the lives of over one million children in the next five years, with an equivalent number of adults,"" says Madhavi.","In Satara, Madhavi Jadhav is talking sex, periods, other subjects with parents, school children","999769726","2018-11-21","https://yourstory.com/2018/11/in-satara-madhavi-jadhav-is-talking-sex-periods-other-subjects-with-parents-school-children/","YourStory.com",FALSE

"5594","","BENGALURU: On November 5, Amitesh Das, a class seven student wrote an essay that read, ""The games we play on our gadgets keep coming in our head, like, 'I need this player in this game' or 'I need to reach the next level' and keep our minds engaged and keep our concentration away from studies and our academic performance falls."" Amitesh was one among the many students of Bethany High, Koramangala, who took part in the Digital Detox Champion Award. His essay goes on to end with, ""If we leave these games, we can spend more time outside and spend more quality time studying... This is how digital detox helps us.""

The Digital Detox initiative was launched in July, where children were told that regulating their use of the internet and gadgets could help them gain rewards and recognition. The management, students and parents agreed upon a policy that the parents will share the child's electronic usage time with the school. Dr Akash Ryall, director of Bethany High, says, ""Some parents approached us and told us they were struggling with having a conversation with their kids. They requested the school to intervene. When we researched digital addiction, we found that it can be worse than substance addiction.""

Rewards were distributed across three categories: Those who gave up their gadgets completely, those who used it only on weekends and those who used gadgets for only one hour every day. ""We announced the results during the general assembly so as to motivate more students to take part in it. And for those who didn't take part, we will be holding another round. The winners will be declared at the end of the school year, in March,"" says Dr Akash, adding that across seven institutions, around 100 students were given the award.

Beginning early

Besides schools, parents too are turning to digital detox programmes. In April, city-based mother Shalini Srivastava sent her 12-year-old daughter for a detox programme meant for kids aged 10-15 years old. Since it was during the summer vacation, Shalini didn't want her daughter watching TV or surfing the internet for hours. ""I thought it would be a good way for her to indulge in different activities. Once the programme was done, my daughter took an interest in gardening,"" says Shalini.

Ishwarya Kumar Ahmed and Sudhalini Devadason, co-founders and directors of Upturn Learning Solutions LLP, which launched the initiative, soon started getting requests from parents to launch the programme for younger children too. The duo introduced a junior slot (for five-eight year olds) for the second season of the initiative, which will begin towards the end of November.

During season 1, the programme was conducted over the course of eight days. Season two, however, has been planned over a span of 12 weeks. ""We wanted the programme to be more immersive. The kids will get a chance to recreate the famous Malgudi Days and develop an interest in reading and folklore, learn Kalaripayattu, take part in DIY projects and even be part of a fun offline science experiment,"" explains Ishwarya.

Plugging out

In the first week of October, Time Out From Plugins, an initiative started by city-based mother Tejaswi Uthappa, was launched at Delhi Public School - Bangalore North. The idea was simple: To get students to pledge to time out from plug-ins. Tejaswi recalls instances where parents in her circle would tell her they don't see themselves in their children's lives anymore or have to compete with a screen for their attention. ""The idea was never to abstain. Instead, by logging out of devices for two hours, we could prevent misuse and spend that time fostering real world connections with our loved ones,"" she says.

"5597","","Thane: A group of parents have raised concerns over the stability of a temporary shed erected on the terrace of a city-based school fearing it could harm the students who often used the area for extra-curricular activities. The school administration has claimed otherwise and said the structure was completely safe.

Parents of dozens of students studying in the Brahmand-based Rainbow International School were wary of the weather shed constructed a few months back by the school. The wary parents were shocked to see the temporary structure when they visited the premise recently and feared it could be a huge safety hazard for students who access it regularly for extra-curricular activities.

""The shed could collapse or some of the rods may give way and lead to serious injuries to the students,"" said a concerned parent.

While few parents had initially approached the school regarding the same, they later alerted the India-Wide Parents Association seeking their assistance in dealing with the issue. The association sought images of the structure from the parents and once convinced, immediately wrote to various education departments asking them to look into this matter urgently as the school is set to reopen on Friday.

""Building a temporary shed in a school was a violation of several safety norms including the child safety guidelines among others. The temporary structure could be a safety hazard for students who access the terrace area for extra-curricular activities. We have written to the NCPCR, the education minister, the Maharashtra State Child Right's Commission and the HRD ministry to conduct an inspection and take the necessary action,"" said Anubha Sahai, president of this association.

When contacted, the school authorities claimed the work on the shed was constructed in accordance with the safety norms.

""The safety of our students is our first priority and the structure was put up as a shield against heat and rain. The structure is extremely safe and the area is used only for dance and extra-curricular activities. We are surprised the parents are worried about this. They should have come to us first,"" said Amrita Pereira, spokesperson of the school.

"5598","","Ahmedabad-based myskoolbus is a unique application developed by Pooja Khemka and Preeti Agarwal to ensure the safety of children on school buses by tracking their location in real time.

In our run-up to Women's Entrepreneurship Day, we focus on women from non-metro cities who have battled many odds to become entrepreneurs. 'Small Towns, Big Dreams' pays tribute to their grit, determination and hard work. We start off with myskoolbus.

Born in a conservative Marwari family in Gujarat, Pooja Khemka, Co-founder of myskoolbus, deems herself lucky to have parents who stood by her in every endeavour. Despite some opposition, she joined college and later convinced her parents to allow her to study chartered accountancy.

Entrepreneurship happened to her quite by chance. Marriage and motherhood happened and a specific incident changed her life forever. Once, she was stuck in traffic and missed her son's school bus. She couldn't track the whereabouts of the bus as she was unable to reach the transport manager on the phone. The bus was on the move and it was a harrowing few moments until she located the bus.

These tense moments sowed the seeds for myskoolbus, a school bus GPS-tracking application for parents that she started with her friend Preeti Agarwal. Pooja recounts, ""Has anyone ever thought of the plight of a mother who is eagerly waiting for the arrival of her kids from school and they don't show up on time? I have personally experienced that and the incident left me traumatised.""

Started in 2013 in Ahmedabad, myskoolbus leverages advancements in information technology and telecommunications like GPS mobile tracking, radio frequency identification (RFID), cloud computing and mobile apps to address different pain points. It gives real-time visibility to parents and institute authorities while alerting them on any deviation from the defined thresholds. In short, it ensures the safety of your children, while on the move.

Pooja explains why starting up in Ahmedabad was a good choice. ""I am a homemaker, and for me to balance both family and business was very much essential. Apart from that, controlling costs like lower rents and cheaper resources since we are bootstrapped played a big factor. In addition, relationship and trust are key drivers of awareness and purchase in the small cities. I believe if you are able to carve a niche in a small town, you can corner the market by being the only one in the area,"" she says.

Being a woman entrepreneur based out of a non-metro comes with its own set of challenges. Pooja bemoans the lack of support from local media and feels that startup stories come mostly from metros. ""Also, convincing the clients that women-led startups can deliver long-term quality services at a competitive price was difficult. Communicating and convincing transport contractors and drivers was a major challenge,"" she points out.

""Often, the men would come and tell me in Gujarati, ben aa tamaru kaam nathi (Sister, this is not your work), and I used to be upset to hear that. But with the support of my parents and husband, I overcame situations with ease to provide effective solutions to my clients.""

The sheer lack of technology-led pitching events in a city like Ahmedabad is also a major impediment when it comes to networking. However, Pooja is happy with the mentoring support myskoolbus has received from the Cherie Blair Foundation - London, Facebook's SheLeadsTech programme and the Kalorex Group.

Within a short period, the response has been encouraging. ""When we started, there were many people who challenged our venture for four months saying you cannot do it. It's not a woman's job. In fact, some school authorities also took us lightly. But now the naysayers have been converted into satisfactory clients,"" says Pooja.

Future plans for myskoolbus includes working on transit surveillance with AI support to understand different situations that can arise during the journey like fights among students, misbehaviour or others. It is also planning to venture into individual women and child safety and tracking solutions that includes wristbands, safety bags, among others.","Myskoolbus lets parents breathe easy with its real-time tracking app for school commute","994189633","2018-11-14","https://yourstory.com/2018/11/myskoolbus-tracking-app-school-commute/","YourStory.com",FALSE
"5599","","GREATER NOIDA: Parents of a 14-year-old boy have lodged a complaint at Kasna police station, alleging their son had been beaten up and molested by a group of senior students at a private school in Greater Noida on October 31.

They claimed they had complained to the school management at the time of the incident but the authorities allegedly refused to take any legal action against the accused students. Police have registered a case against two students under POCSO Act.

Police said the alleged molestation took place during an inter-school competition held at the Greater Noida-based private school where students from different institutions had come to participate. The victim, who is a Class VIII student of a different school, had allegedly got into an argument with two senior students of the host school. After a heated exchange of words, the two students allegedly took the junior student to the washroom and molested him.

The 14-year-old boy's parents approached the police and alleged that the Greater Noida school had refused to take action against the two senior students. The police have, however, registered their complaint under Section 323 of the IPC for voluntarily causing hurt and under provisions of sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.

The school management told TOI that the accused could be seen on CCTV taking the 14-year-old boy to the washroom. They said the authorities had conducted an internal investigation in which it was revealed that the junior students had been beaten up after he made a racial slur at the two senior students.

""The victim student had used a racial comment against the accused, which triggered the fight. After the incident came to light, both the victim and the accused students were made to confront each other. The allegations of molestation are baseless,"" a spokesperson of the school said.","Parents say school seniors sexually harassed 14-year-old - Times of India","993823665","2018-11-14","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/parents-say-school-seniors-sexually-harassed-14-yr-old/articleshow/66612174.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"5601","","Admission schedules for city schools vary depending on the board they offer students.(HT )

In the absence of state guidelines to regulate school admissions, the process of enrolling students promises to be stressful for city parents.

Admission process for the academic year of 2019 have commenced with schools following their own timetable. This means parents are running around to fill application forms, attend in-person interviews and take school tours. Keeping track of the multiple timetables is a challenge.

""With the growing competition, one is not sure of making it to a top school and most parents apply in multiple schools. Since there is absolutely no uniformity in admission schedules, there is a lot of time and money lost in the process along with the additional pressure [of a child making the cut] till one gets through a school,"" said Andheri-based Aditi Singh, who is looking to enrol her three-year-old daughter into school this year.

In the past, several organisations and parent groups, like the PTA United Forum, have written to the state education department to come up with a timeframe within which schools across the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) can conduct admissions. However, in the absence of any such guidelines from the state government, each school follows its own schedule and process.

""Each school has its own requirements depending on the board it offers and other factors which make it difficult to regulate admissions,"" said an official at the state education department who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Admission schedules for city schools vary depending on the board they offer students. Most Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools and those offering the Indian Certificate for Secondary Education (ICSE) conduct admissions between October and February. Those offering the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), International Baccalaureate (IB) and International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) begin admissions in August and the process often goes on until January. Most prominent schools under the state board begin their admissions process between December and January.

Prominent city schools charge anywhere between ₹500 and ₹3,000 for an admission form. Some schools also charge to arrange school tours before parents apply. Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA United Forum said, ""With admissions for the next year beginning this early, parents are under immense stress. Many schools conduct interviews with parents and they have to keep up with all the different schedules while they have a full-time job.""

Psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said admission-related anxiety is common in mothers during this season. ""We get many patients who are often anxious about getting through a particular school. Most of this pressure comes through competition with peers and the status attached to a 'good' school,"" said Mundada.","Mumbai: Parents juggle forms, future as kids get ready for school ","985700964","2018-11-03","https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-parents-juggle-forms-future-as-kids-get-ready-for-school/story-6V6hxRrknsWGgsNOFn535H.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"5602","","No violation to be tolerated, welfare of parents top priority: Var

Srinagar: Taking cognizance of reports about some schools indulging in single-point-sale of books and uniforms, Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir (PSAJK) today directed all of its member schools to remain fair and transparent in their dealings and allow books and uniforms to be sold in open market.

The Association in a meeting took strict notice of some reports in media and said that such a behaviour wherein a parent is forced to purchase books, uniforms and other school items from a particular shop or from school itself, won't be tolerated. ""This violates our ethics and principles and I am sure every school adheres to rules. Although there are some black sheep against whom we will take strict action,"" said G N Var Chairman PSAJK. ""We have decided to take steps to take care of such a problem.""

The Association has instructed all of its schools to allow books and uniforms to be sold in the open market. ""Parents can purchase books, uniforms and other items from any shop and there won't be any directive from any school. Plus there won't be any exorbitant rate on the items and everything will be priced reasonably,"" said Var.

The Association also held a meeting with DC Srinagar wherein it was decided that both the sides will take every possible steps to stop the practice. ""The administration will do its job and we will also prevent any abuse of power from our side. Our primary concern is the welfare of students and parents, which will be maintained,"" said Var.

The Association has also formed a committee of educational experts who will prescribe standard books, which can be used in the schools. ""There have been reports that some schools sell low-quality books at high rates just creating doubly whammy for parents. In order to stop this practice we will be coming out with a list of high-quality books that can be prescribed to students based on their merit,"" said Var.

The Association has called for help from the general public to help in streamlining the sector. ""If anybody feels that he is being fleeced by any school or forced to buy books or uniforms from any particular shop, he can contact us and we will immediately take action in this regard,"" said Var.

The Association said that most of the schools adhere to the agreed principles and maintain their standards, however, it is often one dirty fish that spoils the whole pond. The association appealed people to remain cautious of such schools and said that any person can register their complaint on Association Phone No 7889578450.

"5603","","GURUGRAM: Parents of a seven-year-old boy murdered inside his school campus approached the Supreme Court on Thursday, challenging an order by the Punjab and Haryana high court to refer the case back to the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) of Gurugram for re-consideration and terming the process adopted to declare the juvenile suspect an adult ""illegal"".

The JJB had in December last year declared that the juvenile, who was over 16 years at the time of the alleged murder, would face trial as an adult. It had taken cognisance of the amended Juvenile Justice Act, which says any juvenile in the age group of 16-18 can be treated as an adult in case of heinous offences.

But the juvenile's father had challenged the order before a sessions court, which had upheld the JJB order. The father had then filed a petition in the high court. On October 11, the high court had ruled that the case be referred back to the JJB for re-consideration and had dubbed the process adopted by the board for its judgment ""illegal"".

Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for the Class II student's parents, said on Thursday they had countered the ground on which the HC had passed its October 11 order. ""We have filed a petition in SC challenging the HC order,"" said Tekriwal.

While passing the order, the HC had considered the juvenile suspect's submission that they had not been given a copy of the social and psychological report, on the basis of which the juvenile had been declared an adult.

Apart from terming the JJB's process illegal, the HC had also directed the board to take the help of a psychologist. The SC petition challenged this, pointing out that the JJ Act clearly mentioned that seeking the help of an experienced psychologist or other experts for such an assessment was optional and not mandatory.

""The HC must have formed an independent medical board to corroborate the views of the two courts before passing the impugned order,"" the petition highlights.

Following the HC order, the JJB in Gurugram has started a fresh assessment of the juvenile. On Thursday, he was given a personal hearing by the board, which will now make an assessment. The JJB will also constitute a board on November 3 for medical and psychological assessment of the juvenile suspect.

The Class II student, whose parents moved the SC on Thursday, was found with his throat slit and oozing blood inside the school bathroom in September last year. Within hours of the incident, Gurugram police had arrested a bus conductor. Following a persistent demand by the aggrieved family, the Haryana government had handed over the probe to the CBI. The investigation agency arrested a Class XI student of the same school for the alleged murder and gave a clean chit to the bus conductor.","School murder: Parents of 7-year-old boy move SC - Times of India","984233613","2018-11-01","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/school-murder-parents-of-7-year-old-boy-move-sc/articleshow/66468081.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Interestingly, Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has begun a massive audit to ensure the schools are fully utilising the facilities. According to the parents, the District Education Officer during a recent visit found the school did not comply with the rules. R Sivankutty Nair, the parent of a student, said the school authorities shifted the classroom to wreak vengeance on the class teacher of 9A. ""The move also prevented the students from getting quality education.

""There are some assigned people. Once the technicians shift it to the recently-constructed building, all students will be able to use the facilities.

"5605","","British food writer Ella Woodward famously said: ""There's no such thing as 'bad' food or 'good' food."" But teachers of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Alappuzha don't seem to agree. It seems like 'good food' means boiled rice for them, and everything else is, well, not so great.

Students say the school, one of the prominent private higher secondary schools in the district, has made boiled rice mandatory for lunch for all students and has instructed them not to bring other food items for lunch more than twice a month - including rice-based dishes like idli and dosa.

""Sick parents"" are excused to pack something else for his/her ward for a day or two, but they must inform the concerned class teacher beforehand.

The school has also formed ""inspection teams"" consisting of two or three teachers, who visit classes during the lunch breaks almost every day, to check if students are following the order.

""They visit our class almost everyday to see what we are eating. If somebody is seen eating something else, they are asked why they have not brought rice and our parents are contacted over the phone. If the student repeats it, he/she is scolded by the teachers,"" a class VI student said.

However, school principal Dr S Lali refuted the claim. ""(Only) Non-vegetarian food items are strictly prohibited in the school. The teachers randomly visit classes to check if anybody is bringing meat to class. Biscuits, oily snacks, and aerated drinks are also not promoted in school. (Otherwise) Teachers are only asked to check if students are eating properly or not,"" she said.

She also said there are no other food restrictions in place in the school. ""Earlier, students of junior classes used to waste food and when asked they used to say they were packed things that they don't like. Some parents, looking for an easy way out, pack them items from the previous night after heating them. This monotony triggers a dislike towards food among them, she said.""

""No practice is in place that a parent should alert the class teacher for giving them something other than rice. But they bring chappati, idli, puttu or dosa all five days and rice is completely avoided,"" she went on to underline.

Not all parents agree. Stating that she usually contacts her daughter's class teacher when she has not packed rice, the mother of a class VII student said: ""No parent will purposefully give poor food to their ward and I don't think it is unfair to consider their tiffin preferences. Also, is it not a crime to be scolded before the whole class?""

'Rice is not special'

So, does the consumption of boiled rice make big a difference to the health of the child? Is it more nutritional than other popular food items?

No, says Dr Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, Kochi-based consultant clinical nutritionist.

""Rice is not mandatory. Calorie wise, there is only a negligible amount of difference between rice and wheat. Hence, there is no harm in giving them chappatis or curd rice for lunch. Packed lunch of a schoolgoer should meet one-third of his/her total daily calorie and protein requirements. They shouldn't skip breakfast or lunch but that doesn't mean rice should be force-fed. A balanced diet should be the only priority,"" she notes.

But, Dr Mumtaz agreed that it is better to avoid monotony and bring variety into the child's food habits.

Parents, though, ask how is this possible if the school authorities keep insisting on a particular food regime.

School principal Dr Lali said, ""If children prefer idli or dosa, let them have it. But it can't be permitted with just chutney or sambar; healthy side dishes like 'aviyal' or raw vegetables is a must.""

Parents' choice matters

But can a school possibly dictate what the students can eat and cannot?

""The school has no right to do so. Children of school-going age are minors and thus their guardians can decide what to cook for their children. Such a decision will be valid only if it is unanimously passed by the Parents Teachers Association,"" said advocate G Harikumar of District Court, Alappuzha.

Another parent stressed that no such meeting has happened yet at Chinmaya school. ""Usually, PTA meets happen class-wise. Can't talk for others but they haven't asked my opinion in this matter yet. Though I can understand the intention behind such a decision, I don't think all parents and kids will be okay with it. Rice is Kerala's staple food, but there are many who prefer other cereals over rice,"" the parent, whose child studies in Class X, said.

Pupils who spent their formative years abroad are allowed to bring other food for lunch, the principal confirmed.

That is another sore point. ""Are they not concerned about the nutrition needs of those students? If rules are implemented, everybody should be treated equally. Aren't such exemptions and preferences unfair?"" another parent asks.","Parents say rice made must in this Kerala school, teachers check lunchboxes","976569270","2018-10-23","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2018/oct/23/parents-say-rice-made-must-in-this-kerala-school-teachers-check-lunchboxes-1889023.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

""Her parents tried to get her admission into many private schools of the city, but they all refused. While the other schools did not give the parents any explanation, one private school categorically told them that they cannot give admission to her as she is a rape victim,"" Chauhan said.

The girl had been allegedly gang raped by four students of her former boarding school on August 14. Although she had informed school authorities, they tried to hush it up. The matter came to light in September, when the girl thought she was pregnant and informed her elder sister, following which Dehradun's senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nivedita Kureti was tipped off.

The four boys were taken into custody and the boarding school's director, principal, administration officer, his wife and hostel caretaker were also arrested for alleged destruction of evidence and trying to hush up the matter.

The CBSE had discontinued the school's affiliation as its response to a show cause notice was ""evasive and insensitive"", according to reports.

Advocate Chauhan has written to senior superintendent of Uttarakhand police as well, demanding an investigation into how the girl's identity was revealed.

""The biggest question is that how did the school get to know the child was a rape victim? By law, her identity has to be protected. We want the police to investigate who is behind this,"" she said.

The school authorities were not immediately available for the comment.

Chauhan also demanded the cancellation of the school's affiliation by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

However, regional officer of CBSE Ranveer Singh said he has not received any such letter.

""It is the school's prerogative to give admission or not. There are many factors which influence a school's decision. It is not right on the parts of parents and the lawyer to make such allegations,"" Singh said.

Chauhan said the ""defeated"" parents of the girl wanted to shift her out of Dehradun from the next academic session, but were ""left with no choice"" and got her admitted to a school in a different state.

"5608","","BENGALURU: Parents of children studying at the Chrysalis High School in Kadugodi limits, who were having nightmares about their children attending school with the approach road flooded during rains, heaved a sigh of relief on Sunday when the BBMP started repair work.

However, their joy was shortlived as the work, which began after an assurance by MLA Aravind Limbavalli, stopped the very next day with only the worst bits of the road being patched up in a hurried manner. On Tuesday, the situation was back to normal with the road flooded and the school un-approachable, parents rued.

Located just outside the boundaries of the Kadugodi ward, the road is partly under the jurisdiction of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat. As a result, the road, around 2 kilometres in length from the main Whitefield-Kadugodi-Hosakote Road, is untarred, muddy and narrow. A few days ago, owing to heavy flooding, the school sent out a warning and operated shuttles till a residential neighbourhood to avoid having their students wade through the waters to reach school.

This incident finally caught the attention of the MLA who then assured that work would be done. ""I thought I would do a fact check and found that only a small stretch has been metalled. But that is not going to help in anyway,"" says Tinu Cherian, a parent.

According to him, it is not possible to walk to school or get there by two-wheeler when the road is flooded. ""Added to this, is the chaos from the whitetopping work on the main road.

However, according to the BBMP, work will soon be underway to provide an alternative access road to the school. ""This road is partly the responsibility of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat. However, since the condition was pitiable, we did some very basic road repairs with jelly and other materials. On Monday, there was a survey of the road and also of another route which can connect to the school. Work on this route will begin in 15 days,"" said S Muniswamy, Councillor of the Kadugodi ward.

Meanwhile, the BBMP will create an alternative for the water that accumulates on the road to flow. ""We will at least ensure that there will be no water logging on the road. It is most likely due to some encroachments which will also be cleared,"" he said.","Bumpy road to Bengaluru school has parents fuming","971386688","2018-10-17","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/oct/17/bumpy-road-to-bengaluru-school-has-parents-fuming-1886335.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"5609","","Parents of children studying in leading Chembur school angry after school bus attendants lose sleeping child in busy Kurla area

Shweta Jain thought she knew where her three-year-old was -- where else would she be on a Tuesday morning but in school? But an hour after she watched her daughter board the bus to her school in Chembur, her husband got a call from a stranger, informing them he had seen the toddler crying on the footpath in Kurla.

""We were at home when my husband received the call. We could not believe what we had heard, as I had watched Anushi boarding the school bus that morning,"" recalled Shweta.

Their daughter, Anushi, 3, is a nursery student at Green Acre school in Chembur. She was found on the footpath in Nehru Nagar, which was a whole 7 km away from the school and wasn't even on the bus route.

""We called the school first to verify what was happening. Only after our call did the school authorities check her class and realise that she was absent. We immediately rushed to Kurla to pick up our child. We are very fortunate that our daughter is safe,"" said the mother, expressing her gratitude to the caller who found her daughter.

Angry parents gather at Govandi police station to protest over the school's negligence

The good Samaritan, Rajesh Shah, runs a general store with his brother right where Arushi was spotted. Since his son studies in the same school, he recognised the uniform.

""From my shop, I spotted the little girl crying, and rushed there immediately. She was so scared, she could not answer questions properly. I immediately brought her to our shop, where my brother and I tried to calm her down. I called the school's landline, but was shocked when the official responded that I should contact the parents instead. I then called the number on the child's ID card and spoke to her father,"" said Shah.

""Understandably, her parents did not believe me at first. They thought their daughter was in school, and Nehru Nagar is nowhere near it. But once they confirmed it with the school, they rushed to my shop. Both of them were crying and distressed,"" he said, further adding, ""I am immensely happy that I was able to help the family. I read news reports about unfortunate incidents every day, and am glad that I was able to avoid one here.""

Rajesh Shah found the toddler and reunited her with her parents

What happened

According to Shweta, Anushi had fallen asleep on the bus, and the attendant forgot about her. Once the other kids alighted at the school, the bus headed to Kurla for some work. It was parked at Nehru Nagar, where Anushi woke up. Out of habit, she exited the bus but got scared upon realising that she was in an unfamiliar place. After walking on the footpath for a while, she started crying and was found by Shah.

Shah added that while her parents turned up soon after he called, the bus driver got there around 9.15 am, but the school authorities only arrived around 10 am. The Jains and Shah both called out the school's negligence.

Shweta said, ""Anushi was crying inconsolably after we were renuited. She told me that she was afraid of getting lost again, and so she did not want to go to school anymore.

""We took her home and then rushed to the police station to lodge a complaint against the school. But the school authorities have assured us of immediate action in the matter, promising more stringent regulations for students' safety. We want this assurance in writing, along with an apology letter, within 24 hours, otherwise we will lodge an FIR against the school,"" said Anushi's father, Piyush, while waiting at Govandi police station.

Other parents angry too

Shah said, ""My child studies in the same school, and if this is their approach towards safety, it is a matter of concern."" The incident caused major anger among other parents at the high-profile school as well. Several of them arrived at the police station in solidarity with the Jains, and laid out a list of issues with the school's transport services.

""It is a mandatory bus service by the school for all children, for which they charge heavily. The least we can expect is the safety of our children. It is very irresponsible of the lady attendant to forget a child. What is the point of having a lady attendant and CCTV cameras when our kids are still not safe? They charge us anywhere between Rs 24,000 and Rs 36,000 per year,"" said one of the parents.

Another added, ""How could the school not notice that the child was absent, even though she was marked present on the bus? The school should have at least been sensitive enough to swing into action upon finding out what had happened.""

School says

Rachana Laxminarayanan, school principal, said, ""It was an unfortunate incident, and we support the parents. We rushed to the spot as soon as we got to know about it. The attendant was unwell today, so there was a human error, as she did not switch on the CCTV surveillance. We are going to terminate the services of the bus contractor. A meeting will be held with parents to understand their concerns regarding transport services, to make appropriate changes.""

Expertspeak

There is no clarity on who should be held responsible for the incident, since the school bus policy does not apply to playgroups or nurseries. Social activist Indrani Malkhani, who was an integral part of the committee that formed the school bus policy, explained, ""The school bus policy is applicable to buses running for schools. School starts from Std I, so buses for lower classes can't be called schoolbuses.""","Mumbai: Samaritans spot missing child but Chembur school says: contact parents","971338734","2018-10-17","https://www.mid-day.com/articles/mumbai-samaritans-spot-missing-child-but-chembur-school-says-contact-parents/19897185","mid-day",FALSE
"5610","","MAWKYRWAT: Ranikor MLA Pius Marwein has laid emphasis on education as a medium to build a healthy society and urged parents, especially in rural areas, to send their children to school.

Addressing a gathering on the concluding day of the Rangjadong Government LP School Golden Jubilee celebrations on Friday, Marwein said there are many poor families in Ranikor constituency who cannot afford to send their children to school.

""Education is not only for getting a job but it also leads to development of the village or a society as a whole. It is very important because when children attend school, villages develop, the society is different and it can provide different opportunities especially in terms of livelihood. As parents, even though we will have to face many problems to feed our families, we should not deprive children of education,"" he added.

While urging the people to take advantage of free education provided by the government, Marwein reminded parents that many successful people came from poor families. Marwein also lauded the efforts of the managing committee for running the school for the past 50 years.

The Salem district police have arrested three people for opposing her appointment.

While the Deevattipatty police managed to arrest M Devan, 55, P Chinnatambi, 56, and G Mahendran, 38, all residents of K Morur on Saturday, three more people - headmaster of the school C Ammasi, 50, P Sekar, 35, and C Venkatesh, 38, residents of K Morur - are absconding.

The victim S Jothi, 47, who had been working as an assistant to the cook at the Government High School at K Morur, was promoted as cook and transferred to the Kuppankottai Elementary School on Monday a few days earlier. The school has 47 students.

Telangana Parents Association for Child Rights and Safety (TPACRS), which came up with the guidelines, said that parents and police should be made stakeholders and should be given responsibility of looking after safety and security of students.

""Parents should be asked to volunteer for an hour or so in schools to look after safety of their wards. This method is followed in the western countries and is very efficient. Also, as the school education department has failed miserably at ensuring security of children in educational institutions, police should be involved and make sure that schools are following all the guidelines,"" said Mohammed Asif Hussain Sohail, president, TPACRS adding that there are about 11,000 parents in the association.

The parents further said that movements of primary students inside the campus should be completely monitored and police verification should be made mandatory for all staff.

""School campus should be divided into specific areas and have caretakers, parents or other volunteers, monitor the place all day long, especially during breaks.

Conversations from China's popular WeChat group have become viral online where it is seen one of the child's teacher writing that some guardians raised objection to Li choosing a fancy sports car to drop his kid at school for they fear that it could result in ""class divisions"" among the students in the classroom, Shanghaiist reported.

Li reportedly earns more than 4 million yuan a year (nearly INR 4.3 crore) and it is no wonder that he can afford a Ferrari as his mode of transportation. But his fellow parents have accused him of flaunting his wealth and advised him to choose a more modest vehicle when dropping his child at the institution.

Li, however, refused to oblige. He is of the opinion that he worked hard to make his fortunes and will not just buy another car because others wanted him to.

""What's wrong with wanting to provide the very best for my child? If seeing someone else driving a sports car hurts your children's feelings, then they are too sensitive,"" Li wrote.

"5614","","HYDERABAD: Having received no cooperation from either school authorities or the education department, parents of children studying in Azaan International School have decided to take their battle to courts. The fate of 1,600 students enroled in the school hangs in balance as the government is mulling shutting down the school after at least two cases of sexual abuse of children were reported.

The department has already shut down pre-primary classes and has also reportedly recommended CBSE to de-recognise the school's primary and higher classes too. Parents allege that the education department officials have done precious little, despite tall promises, to get the 290 children who were enrolled in nursery and kindergarten classes readmitted in other schools.

Earlier, officials had promised parents that they would get assistance in securing admissions for their children in other schools of their choice. Now, several parents feel the department officials are shirking responsibility. ""How will we know which schools have affiliation and which don't? Instead of giving us names of recognised schools, they have just asked us to choose,"" says Aasiya Khanam, a parent. While parents have been vocal about not wanting the school to be shut down, lack of response from the school management has left parents in two minds.

It has come to light that soon after the closure of the pre-primary section, the management had assured parents that classes would be made operational. It had also assured that classes would be run during the Dussehra vacations to make up for those lost last month when the school for shut for 10 days. However, it "" unexpectedly' declared a 10-day long vacation on Monday, leaving parents confused about its intent. Earlier on 1 October, parents under the aegis of Azzan Internation Parents Association met the management and submitted a charter of demands.

These pertain to the removal of staff in including directors and principal; upgradation of security on the premises; and formulation of a parents, teachers and management association and a grievance cell. The management has sought time till October 15 to respond to these demands, failing which the association said it will take legal action.

Parents who were aggrieved over the shortage of teachers along with students of the Dhaushire-Usgao school staged a morcha at the assistant district educational inspector's (ADEI), Ponda office demanding deputing of full-time teachers in school until academic year culminates.

ADEI, Ponda has given written assurance to parents that the newly-transferred teacher will not leave the school until the culmination of present academic year.

"5616","","When police officers arrived at the school to nab the accused, guardians of students allegedly got into an altercation with school authorities and demanded that the accused be handed over to them.

Days after a 5-year-old girl was allegedly molested by a teacher at a Kolkata school, parents of students protested outside the premises Tuesday, calling for action against the accused. A case was lodged the same day, after which the accused teacher was arrested.

""The teacher has been accused of sexually abusing a minor student. A probe is on,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East Division) Kalyan Mukherjee told The Indian Express. The incident allegedly occurred on September 26.

Police sources said the protest turned violent when police personnel were escorting 300-500 students out of the school premises. They suspect that the protesters saw teachers attempting to leave the school amidst the students, following which they began pelting stones. The police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the crowd.

Apart from the accused teacher, the police also arrested four protesters for their involvement in the violence, sources said. ""During the scrimmage, eight to 10 police personnel sustained injuries and are under treatment at different hospitals. One woman demonstrator was also injured but left the place on her own. Four trouble-makers have been arrested,"" said an official.

The police released a statement which read, ""Today at about 9.45 am, information was received from officer-in-charge of Lake police station that trouble sprouted at a school... Police were informed that aggrieved guardians of the students started staging a demonstration over an alleged molestation incident which reportedly happened on September 26 during school hours. The parents of the victim lodged a complaint at the police station today.""

Police sources said action was taken immediately after the complaint was lodged. A case was registered at Lake police station under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and under the POCSO Act.

When police officers arrived at the school to nab the accused, guardians of students allegedly got into an altercation with school authorities and demanded that the accused be handed over to them. In the ruckus that followed, a teacher was manhandled and some protesters were injured.

Later, a meeting was held between parents, school authorities, police and a local councillor of Kolkata Municipal Corporation to solve the issue. During the meeting, parents demanded that no male teacher should be allowed in the school.

""They demanded that all male teachers be removed from the girls' school. I will convey this to the education minister. For the time being, it has been decided that only female teachers will take classes till Class V,"" said councillor Ratan Dey.

Primary school council chairman Kartick Chandra Manna told reporters, ""It is an unfortunate incident. Everything has been conveyed to our education minister. For the time being, the accused teacher will not be allowed in the school. If he is found guilty action will be taken. A probe will be done. A few outsiders took advantage of the incident and triggered tension in the area. Police have identified them and action will be taken against each of them.""

Repeated calls to school authorities went unanswered.

""If the school and police had acted in the very beginning, such vandalism wouldn't have taken place. Female protesters were beaten up by the police for no reason,"" said one of the protesters, Mousumi Mondal.

A team from the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights also visited the spot. ""We are keeping a close watch on the incident. Police have already arrested the accused. If he is found to be guilty, proper action will be taken,"" said Ananya Chattopadhyay, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

"5617","","KOLKATA: Allegations of sexual abuse on a six-year-old girl by her schoolteacher led to a violent demonstration outside a government-aided school in south Kolkata on Tuesday morning when the police and the guardians got caught in a pitched battle, with the cops resorting to lathicharge, apparently to disperse the swelling number of protesters.

At least three guardians were injured, one of them having sustained head injury in the lathicharge. Besides, two teachers and 10 cops, including Lake police station OC Suman Kumar Dey and Gariahat police station OC Sumit Dasgupta, were injured. The accused teacher, Dipak Karmakar (58), a resident of Vidyasagar Colony, was taken to the Lake police station and arrested after his version seemed questionable. He has been charged with Section 10 of POCSO Act and several other sections of the IPC. Four guardians have also been rounded up for rioting and vandalizing and are likely to be arrested. ""We have arrested the accused. We are abiding by children rights commission's regulations. The situation turned tense as the residents took law in their hands. ,"" said a senior police officer. The cops claimed they apparently acted in defence.

The school education department has called for a probe even as it instructed the institute to lodge a complaint of rioting. Police have been asked to provide security on Wednesday, when an attempt will be made to reopen the school.

According to the girl's mother, the upper-KG girl was assaulted by Karmakar, who taught English and Bengali at the school, on September 26. Since it was the day the BJP had called a bandh, only 21of the 40 students were present. ""After she returned home, I noticed she was behaving unnaturally. But she did not open up. For the past few days, she had been refusing to go to school,"" her mother said. Only recently, did she tell her parents about the torture. The child reportedly told her parents that Karmakar had taken her to a separate room where he allegedly physically assaulted her. The parents informed the school about the assault but the authorities apparently did nothing about it. The parents claimed to have a doctor's report, saying child was physically abused. ""The school runs between 6.30am and 8.30am. after which the students are provided with mid-day meal around 9am before the classes are called off,"" an officer said. ""After that, special sessions are held for students facing difficulty with lessons. Karmakar apparently used this pretext to take the child to a room on the first floor, where he sexually assaulted her,"" said an officer.

The school, however, denied the allegation, saying they were informed about the incident only on Tuesday morning when the principal came out to speak to the survivor's mother. The principal alleged the girl's parents, along with scores of other guardians, demanded that Karmakar be handed over to them immediately and that they did not respond to her repeated attempts to open a dialogue. The police said it was around 8am that they received a call from the school. ""A team from the Lake police station went to the school and brought the accused to the police station. We questioned him, found his answers to be questionable and arrested him,"" said an officer. ""However as the word of sexual abuse spread, the crowd kept swelling. The parents initially staged a demonstration pointing to lax security at the school. But around 10am, they began demanding that the accused be handed over to them. When the crowd started to turn violent, we summoned forces from the Gariahat and Rabindra Sarobar police stations.""

""Stopped from barging into the school, the protesters reportedly pelted the cops with stones and managed to break open the main gate. But with cops standing as a barricade, they could go no further in but they attacked the personnel,"" claimed an officer. Some from the crowd -- ruffians from nearby slums also apparently joined in -- vandalized cars and bikes parked on the road. They even reportedly tried to torch a bike, after which cops resorted to lathicharge. What followed was a bloodied ""battle"" of three hours, in which the mother of a child suffered severe head injuries, after being allegedly hit by a cop with a lathi. Several guardians alleged they were kicked by cops. A teacher was attacked by the protesters only to be saved by the students.

Shortly, the school authorities sat with the cops and school education department officers and took four decisions: to reopen school within 24 hours with police help, the accused cannot attend school till the probe is over, a rioting case will be filed by school and a proper probe will be launched into abuse allegation and a report will be submitted. ""We have several CCTV cameras on the premises and we want the truth to come out,"" claimed a teacher.

Ananya Chakraborti, chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, who visited the school said they were extending legal and counselling help. ""She is in trauma. The commission will keep an eye on the probe and may seek CCTV images,"" she said.","6-year-old abused at school; cops lathi charge protesting parents - Times of India","965692857","2018-10-10","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/6-year-old-abused-at-school-cops-lathi-charge-protesting-parents/articleshow/66141950.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

Kolkata police on Tuesday baton charged an agitating group of parents and guardians outside a school as they were protesting the alleged sexual harassment of a six-year-old girl by a teacher.

The accused teacher was arrested, said a police officer. The alleged sexual harassment took place on September 26. Protests began on Tuesday morning as guardians gathered outside Binodini Girls' High School that was set up in 1938 in Dhakuria, a middle class neighbourhood in south Kolkata.

""The accused has been arrested. We appeal to the guardians to understand that the law will deal with the accused. Policemen have been injured,"" said Santosh Nimbalkar, deputy commissioner, southern suburban division, Kolkata Police.

Parents and guardians alleged that a male teacher had sexually harassed the six-year-old a few days ago. TV channels played images of a woman bleeding profusely from the forehead after she was allegedly hit by police.

Policemen who rushed to the spot alleged that the protesters pelted stones at them. Police said they were also targeted by residents of houses near the school. The protesters vandalised a two-wheeler parked outside the school that allegedly belonged to the accused teacher.

The clash with the police began when some of the protesters tried to enter the school forcefully after rumours that the accused was hiding inside the school.","Police in Kolkata clash with parents outside school after allegations of teacher molesting girl surface","964995269","2018-10-09","https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/police-in-kolkata-clash-with-parents-outside-school-after-allegations-of-teacher-molesting-girl-surface/story-mYH4U8SjV3YkcK6cEJ48hL.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"5627","","Eighty two-year-old Shamkant A Patil, a resident of Bhau Patil road, Bopodi, runs an NGO, Shreenath Swami Bahuddeshiya Sanstha, through which he has been trying to spread awareness about the unacceptable weight of school backpacks of children.

What are the major concerns surrounding the weight of school bags?

Schoolgoing children have been burdened with heavy bags. I have seen young students carry bags weighing upto 10 kg everyday on their shoulders. It is no more just books, but several other materials like project stationery, large or multiple tiffin boxes, umbrella, raincoat, sports uniform, etc. in additional to the conventional notebooks and stationery. All this will cause major health hazards for students, harming their growth, both physically and intellectually.

Has the government taken any step to check this?

The government has taken steps, but they aren't strong enough. There was a government directive in July 2015 which strictly restricted schools from allowing students carrying weight more than 10 per cent of their body weight. Even the PCMC education department recently started the 'No School Bag Day' policy on the first and third Saturday of every month in civic-run schools. But, all that cannot change the overall scenario, because both parents and schools need to be actively involved in its implementation. More awareness programmes and stringent laws can help.

Can you suggest possible solution(s) for this?

I have noticed students carry a lot of weight, just not of notebooks, but textbooks as well. One of the measures is to recycle books. These textbooks can be kept on the school premises and can be used by the students during school hours. Also, many students end up taking more books to school, even of those subjects which are not in the routine, in the fear of being called out in the class for not having it. Many a times, classes in school often get switched and the routine changes, so students are scared to be in such a spot. The recycling process, really helps as they would not have to carry any books at all. Also, if required, these students can keep another copy of the same book in their homes for home study or borrow the same books from the school during examinations. The other suggestion is spreading more awareness, which we have been working towards.","Schools, parents need to join hands to reduce weight of school bags, says Shamkant A Patil","962208205","2018-10-05","https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/schools-parents-need-to-join-hands-to-reduce-weight-of-school-bags-says-shamkant-a-patil/story-iz0ejtV6M4IRfkZw1NWnIJ.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"5630","","State order to restrict offs in primary schools to 76 per year draws criticism

Angry over lack of teachers in a zilla parishad-run primary school at Karanjote village in Bhiwandi, parents of children attending classes there put a lock on the main gate of the school on September 25. Residents said they took the step after their demands for increasing the number of teachers ""fell on deaf ears"". The school currently has two teachers for more than 100 students, claimed a local resident.

Ramesh Jadhaw, father of a six-year-old girl, said: ""This is the only school for nearly five villages and adivasi padas. Children come from different villages, travelling several kilometres. However, there is no teacher for them. So what is the point of having a school?""

Jadhaw is one of the many residents, who have been demanding that the school be better equipped to teach over 100 students attending classes there.

""The school conducts classes till standard seven. The headmaster looks after a few standards, but mostly it is just one teacher who teaches all the subjects in all seven standards. How can one person teach so many children?"" asked Ashwini Gavle, parent of a seven-year-old.

Parents claimed that even those two teachers are absent on many occasions. ""Of the few days that the school was open, the teachers are mostly engaged in either government deputation or training. How are they expected to teach our children?"" Gavle added.

Residents of Karanjote village claimed to had written to all senior authorities. ""We wrote to the education officer at the zilla parishad multiple times since 2016. Some of us even visited the officer. But nothing changed,"" said Sukanya Jadhaw, a local resident.

""In September, the children had hardly a week of school... while the rest of the days were declared holiday. Why is the education department carrying on with this farce? This is not how a school functions,"" she added.

On September 25, when the teachers did not turn up at the school, parents took all the children out and put a lock on the front gate of the four-roomed school premises in the middle of the village, sources said. ""We won't let anyone reopen the school unless the number of teachers is increased. Under the Right to Education law, there has to be a teacher for 30 children. We want at least that rule to be followed,"" said Krushna Jadhaw, another parent.

Meanwhile, Bhiwandi Zilla Parishad Education Officer Sanjay Thorat said: ""There were supposed to be four teachers at the school. There were three earlier, one of whom had been involved in some tussle with the villagers. We have added one teacher to the current situation and the parents have agreed to start the school again from Tuesday.

"5631","","Police said three cases came to light when the parents approached the school separately to check whether the seats in junior kindergartens have been confirmed for their children

Three persons have been arrested for allegedly cheating parents of the students seeking admission at St Joseph and Don Bosco high schools.

While Chandrakant Bhosale (27) was arrested from Kurla railway station Tuesday, his associates, Radheshyam Bindra (32) and Shyamlal Rajbhar (34), were arrested by the Matunga police on September 27 after they were brought in for questioning. They have been accused of preparing fake payment receipts in the name of the schools.

Police said three cases came to light when the parents approached the school separately to check whether the seats in junior kindergartens have been confirmed for their children. ""When they went to the respective schools with the payment receipts, the parents came to know that they have been duped. The Father of St Joseph High School came to the police station and handed us a written complaint,"" said an officer.

During preliminary investigation, the police learnt that the group had cheated three parents of Rs 1.20 lakh, Rs 1.05 lakh and Rs 75,000, respectively.

""The parents identified the main accused as Chandrakant Bhosale, who had claimed that he is in good terms with the principals and could help them with their ward's admissions. Later, with the help of his call data records, Bhosale was arrested from Kurla station,"" the officer said.

""We came to know that the accused had given the parents receipts of much lesser amounts than to they had actually paid for admission. Bhosale had claimed that the school would not want to mention the donation amount in the receipt,"" the officer added.

Following Bhosale's arrest, the roles played by Bindra and Rajbhar came to light. ""Earlier this year, Bhosale had wanted to print fake receipts of the schools. He initially approached Bindra, who guided him to the third accused. Rajbhar has alleged that Bhosale was introduced to him as an employee of Don Bosco High School... and that the school would give him a printing contract on Bhosale's recommendation,"" the officer said.

So far, the police have come to know that the group has cheated three parents. The three have been booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged), 472 (making or possessing counterfeit seal with intent to commit forgery punishable) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.

The association in a release said the bandh would disrupt the education schedule but involve students in a fight which was not theirs.

The association said that if the schools reserved the right to bully the government with a set of demands, justified or unjustified, the students, parents and teachers should also be tolerated when they exercised their right to basic protest or making a complaint against gross illegal profiteering by schools and their attitude to safety and security issues. The HSPA said neither the parents nor the teachers were a party to the bandh call.

"5633","","BENGALURU: The Supreme Court's decision that Aadhaar cannot be made compulsory in schools' admission process has thrilled parents, although not all managements are happy with the verdict.

The state education department mandates students submit government identity proof for its Students' Achievement Tracking System (SATS). Since Aadhaar card is the only option for students below 15 years of age, parents had to go through the process of obtaining a unique identification card for their children.

However, since UIDAI reveals biometrics of a person changes once they attain the age of 15 years, it's mandatory to get biometrics revised. This meant parents had to go through the process of obtaining an Aadhaar card for their wards twice.

Prejita Singh, from Electronics City and a parent of a 7-year-old, said, ""I am happy with the verdict of the Supreme Court. I was a little apprehensive when a prominent school in Electronics City asked for Aadhaar details. First, I didn't want to get Aadhaar before my child crossed 15 years of age, and second I had doubts over the security of the data.""

Mahesh Jain, from RT Nagar and a parent of a 12-yearold student, said: ""After a huge hue and cry, I had to submit, my son's Aadhaar card in school. I could not understand the point of submitting Aadhaar details. It left great scope for misuse since schools don't have safe websites or strong cyber teams to handle data theft. I am happy with the verdict.""

Most schools too are pleased with the verdict since it will reduce the workload on staff. M Srinivasan, principal, Gear International School and president, CBSE Schools Association, said, ""I am happy with the verdict. Parents were reluctant to share their children's biometric details with schools. They were not comfortable at all, but the Supreme Court's decision solves the problem.""

Echoing Srivivasan's view, Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of directors, DPS, said, ""It was an additional task for school administrations to collect and maintain Aadhaar data. I hope the Karnataka government also does not make it mandatory, because it would then be difficult to make parents understand why it's important.""

'Will lead to corruption'

But others are unhappy with the court freeing the admission process of Aadhaar data.

""Having Aadhaar records made it possible for us to track students in the long run,"" said Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka. ""Through Aadhaar, we were able to secure details of hundreds of ghost students registered by schools for benefits.

Alleging that the school management is behaving as if they are above the law, parents said the school has been reopened with the sole intention of showing the video to students.

""When police are investigating the issue and the medical report has stated that the girl was sexually exploited, the school has no business to show CCTV footage to students. In fact, the entire day was dedicated only for this purpose and all the staff was busy dealing with angry parents,"" said Mohammed Asif Hussain Sohail, a parent of a Class 2 student, adding that the management continued to show the video to students on Wednesday even after parents and police intervened. Meanwhile, parents, who have already formed an ad-hoc committee, said they have submitted four representations to the management over the safety of their wards but have received no response so far.

Parents also demanded that if the school is going to remain open, it should have only female staff for the girl's block. They also demanded separate entry and exit points for girls and asked the school to ensure a thorough and professional background check of all the existing staff and new recruits. The worried parents also pointed out that even two weeks after the incident, they have no clarity on the future of their children as the education department has not yet issued any communication. ""We don't know if the school will be closed down or will remain open or will be taken over from the management.

Neither the school management nor the education department officials are answering our queries. As it involves the future of 1600 students, they should coordinate with the parents' association,"" said another parent. Meanwhile, officials said they have already asked the school to remain shut until further notice. ""After we came to know that the school reopened on Wednesday, we slapped a notice and asked them to remain closed. We have also received a reply to the show-cause notice from the management.

To avoid missing the half-yearly exam, students piggybacked to school in Koti village on Monday as the water level of the Ghaggar in Morni rose due to the incessant downpour. Parents carried their wards on their back and shoulders while wading through the river. Still, 39 students of Government Senior Secondary School at Koti village missed their exams as they could not cross the river.

As it began raining from Sunday night, the water level of the Ghaggar rose when the students left for school on Monday morning. Exams from classes VI to XI were scheduled for Monday. On Saturday, 18 students from standard IX to XII had already missed the exam due to the same reason.

Jaipal Singh, a resident of Pathrothi village, had to carry his daughter Geetanjali of Standard IX on his back to help her cross the river so that she doesn't miss her exam. ""She was crying that she will miss her exam and at the same time got scared to cross the river. I knew it was risky for her and me too... but at least she felt safe that she was with her father,"" he said.

Paramjeet Singh, another resident of the same village who also carried his daughter Payal, a student of Standard VII, said, ""We are fed up. The government says send your children to school. Yet, have they even provided a proper access to the school.""

In Class VI, eight students missed the exam while in standard VII, four couldn't take the exam. Six students of Standard VIII, nine of Standard IX, seven of Standard X and five of Standard XI failed to take the exam. After walking for three to seven kilometres from their respective villages, these students reached the river bank but couldn't wade through Ghaggar.

The exam was scheduled to take place at 8.30 am. While Standard VI was to take the English exam, standards VII, VIII, IX, X and XI were to take science, Hindi, maths and history, respectively. Surinder, a student of Class X who had his maths exam, came covered in plastic but had to return from the river bank. Surinder had walked seven kilometres from his village Late Batoli to the river bank. But finding the Ghaggar swollen, he couldn't risk crossing the river.

""Does the administration only swing into action after a casualty? We feel so helpless. At least we can get a temporary bridge until a permanent solution is chalked out. What if we are trying to cross and get washed away by the strong current?"" said Surinder. ""We have our boards this time and these examinations are highly important for us. We don't even know whether the school will take our exam again,"" he added.

Brij Kishore Gautam, a teacher of the school, said they were in the process of sending a request to the district education office to allow them to take the exams for these students again. ""Every minute has been difficult for us. We don't even know if we will survive while crossing the river this season and the officials are just speaking about tenders being floated, tenders being opened and what not.... We don't understand these official jargons. Why can't they provide a stopgap arrangement till then,"" said the teacher.

Gautam added that his son Tanmay has been constantly asking whether he would be able to go to school on Tuesday since he missed school today. Panchkula DC Mukul Kumar said he had spoken to the Block Development Officer who said that the villagers had been insisting on a permanent solution only.

However, when the DC was told that the villagers have been asking for at least a temporary solution at present, he said, ""Tomorrow itself, I will get the provision of a temporary bridge explored."" PWD officials said tenders have already been recalled and work will begin soon.

Also written by Alex Binoy

Authorities at the New English School at Landewadi, in Ambegaon taluka of Pune district, have taken an initiative to ensure that parents get multiple updates about the students' whereabouts via SMS throughout the day.

""We have installed a device in all our buses and given I-cards, which contain a chip, to students. So, when the child boards the bus, he or she has to tap their I-card on that device, which automatically sends a message to the parent's phone, informing them that the child has entered the bus. While getting off the bus, the student has to again tap the device with the I-card, and a second message goes to the parent stating that the child has left the bus. A third message is sent when the child enters the school and taps the I-card on a device here. So, by the time the student reaches school, three communications between the parent and the school have taken place,"" said Shabnam Momin, principal of New English School.

""The same way, when children leave the school, they have to tap the device in the school and do the same when they are getting on and off the school bus. In one day, six messages are sent to the parent's phone, updating them on the child's whereabouts,"" she added.

Earlier, the school authorities had installed CCTV cameras and GPS tracking system inside the school buses.

Explaining the reason behind the security measures, Momin said, ""Several incidents of sexual harassment and bullying in school buses have been reported from across India. These are the steps we took to prevent such incidents. The safety and security of our students is always our main priority"".

Vidya Kale, whose three children study in New English School, said, ""This is a great step by the school to ensure the safety of our children. It also has other advantages. Now, I don't need to wait at the bus stop for a long time. I can always track the bus with my phone and go to the bus stop only when the bus is close by.""

Satish Bhere, a student of Class X, said, ""This system also has an added advantage when it comes to attendance.

Earlier, attendance was taken manually and that was a time-consuming job. Now, it is recorded automatically when the student taps the scanning device with his I-card and the data is stored in a database"".

The issue has been hanging fire for years, but while the authorities debate and delay, little children in the city's schools continue to carry the burden of homework and heavy schoolbags. It was in 2016 that the Union Ministry of Human Resources Development directed the CBSE to issue circulars to schools telling them to advise students of classes 1 and 2 not to carry school bags and to stop giving them homework.

The CBSE did issue the circular on September 12, 2016, but seeing little change on the ground, it was pulled up by the Madras High Court on August 11 this year, and advised to enforce its diktat more seriously. A few days later, on August 20, the court ordered the CBSE to publicise in the media that strict action would be taken against schools not following the 'No Homework' rule

And complying, the CBSE's recent circular has advised its affiliated schools to reduce the weight of school bags in the interests of the children's health and not to prescribe home work, which could add to their burden both literally and figuratively speaking. ""Young children whose spine is at a crucial stage of growth are most susceptible to hazards such as back pain, muscle pain, shoulder pain, fatigue and in extreme cases the distortion of spinal chord or shoulders that may most plausibly be attributed to heavy school bags,"" read the circular.

The Karnataka government, which too has been slack in reducing the burden of little children , seems to have finally woken up as well and held a meeting on September 3 this year with private school managements to discuss the twin issues of doing away with heavy school bags at least two days a week and homework all days of the week for students of UKG and classes 1 and 2.

The meeting clearly did not go down well as earlier this week, on September 11, the private school managements condemned the 'unscientific' draft guidelines prescribed by the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) for enforcement in the state

The new guidelines propose that a schoolbag should not be heavier than 10 per cent of the student's body weight and that students from lower kindergarten (LKG) to class 2 should not be allowed to carry more than 2 or 3 kgs of books and students from classes 4 to 7 more than 4 kgs.

Mr D. Shashikumar, general secretary of the Karnataka Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools (KAMS) is categorical in his opposition to these new norms, insisting that such decisions should be backed by proper research. ""The government should work scientifically and give orders that are acceptable to all stakeholders,"" he says, revealing that private school managements in the state are okay with only one ""No Bag Day"" a week.

President of the Managements of Independent CBSE Schools Association (MICSA), M. Srinivasan too is unhappy with the guidelines issued by his board, and insists that giving students homework is necessary as it encourages them to think constructively and contributes to ""better brain development and retention capabilities.""

""Homework encourages students to revise portions taught in school after class hours,"" he says. Strongly critical of both the CBSE and the DSERT for coming up with directives without scientific backing, he says that such decisions should be taken with care. ""A comprehensive survey should be done among students, teachers and parents before making these guidelines the norm,"" he stresses.

Give our kids homework: parents oppose policy

Parents are equally opposed tot he No Homework policy, say principals and teachers. ""Parents love to compare their children's academic progress with that of children from other schools. They like to look into their work books to assess their progress and help them revise what they have learnt in school during the day,"" says a principal of an ICSE school in the city. Arguing that the workload of students till second grade is very small and puts no pressure on them, he says homework helps build their interest in information outside their textbooks.

While one parent, Mr Ravi Nair, an advertising professional whose sons study in grade one and four in a city school, is happy with the government's move on reducing heavy school bags, he believes homework should be done online in future. Welcoming the proposal to have ""No Bag Days,"" he says, ""I have always felt that schools burden children with heavy books, which they don't always need. Instead, students should be trained to go online for any pending work on reaching home to make learning fun. While smartphone applications are easy and feasible to create, even budget schools can develop a platform to make learning and revision an interactive process from home,"" he suggests.

Education expert, Preethi Vickram, however, feels that it is high time the concept of homework underwent a comprehensive transformation. ""Rather than being mere revision, homework should enhance the communication and application skills of children at home. They should be encouraged to interact with parents to know how a particular concept taught at school is used in practice. In short, homework should play a complementary role, rather than being a repetitive process,"" she says.

Responding to the criticism of school managements, principals and parents on the issue, Prof. Niranjanaradhya V.P, head of the universalisation of equitable quality education programme at the Centre for Child and the Law, National Law School of India University (NLSIU) , who was on the committee which drafted the guidelines on homework and schoolbags, says it is unfounded.

""Such policy decisions are taken by the government only on the basis of systematic studies. Doctors were consulted to prescribe the optimal weight of school bags for children of various ages,"" he reveals adding that schools should not blame parents for encouraging them to do homework and instead convince them that their children can do well in their studies even without doing it at this stage of their learning.

"5646","","People protest outside Mukherjee Nagar school where a minor girl was allegedly sexualy assaulted , Zee Media Bureau

Family members of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl who was allegedly molested in her school at north west Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar last week staged a protest outside the school on Tuesday demanding action against the authorities.

They were joined by parents of other schoolchildren and members of some NGOs. They blocked the road and demanded justice for the child.

The parents of the child have alleged that she was sexually assaulted in her school last Tuesday. A case was registered by the district police under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.

The family alleges that when the girl came home on September 4, her private parts were bleeding. They took her to a doctor who suspected sexual assault following which the family reported the matter to the police.

The police today said that the Crime Branch will take over the probe into the alleged sexual assault of the girl.

A senior officer said the case has been transferred to the Crime Branch since it is a ""sensitive one"".

Last week, police had said that it did not rule out the role of the school authority or any family member or neighbour.

Aslam Khan, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (northwest), had said, ""We are investigating the matter from all angles. We are not ruling out the role of the school authority or any family member or neighbour.""

""The doctor has confirmed that it is a case of sexual assault. We have registered an FIR under Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,"" Khan had said.

The police had claimed that the girl was ""touched"" inappropriately.

Meanwhile, the principal of the school said that they have cooperated with the police and have provided all the help needed. Police have checked CCTV footage and have not found anything suspicious, he said.

"5647","","In one of the bizarre incidents, a pole dancer took to the stage and performed at a school ceremony at Kindergarten in China.

The incident is reported to have happened in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.

A video showing a woman wearing a tiny pair of tight black shorts and a black crop top is seen dancing at a school ceremony.

The video also shows children along with their parents watching the show.

The video was shared online by a journalist Michael Standaert whose children were also part of the school celebration.

The journalist posted the video on Twitter saying, ""The principal hung up on my wife when she called after saying it was ""international and good exercise"" ... okay, yeah for adults maybe, but not 3-6 year old kids"".

The journalist also speculated that the head of the school might have received payments for the dance as he saw several advertisements of the pole dancer.

The dance was condemned by the local education bureau and the head of the school was also dismissed after the video went viral.","Watch: Kindergarten school ceremony welcomes kids, parents with pole dance in China","938608846","2018-09-04","http://wionews.com/world/watch-kindergarten-school-ceremony-welcomes-kids-parents-with-pole-dance-in-china-163492","WION",FALSE
"5648","","Videos of the pole dance performance have gone viral on Chinese social media websites.

A Chinese kindergarten principal has apologized after allowing a pole dancer to perform on the school's opening day. Yes, you read that right. A Chinese kindergarten thought it was a good idea to have a scantily clad woman writhing around a pole in the school courtyard on Monday.

American writer Michael Standaert, who is based in the southern city of Shenzhen, was surprised, to say the least, when he and his wife took their children to the privately run Xinshahui kindergarten in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen on Monday.

There, on a stage in the courtyard, in front of rows of children aged 3 to 6, all first-day-ready in pristine white shirts and neatly pressed black shorts, a woman did a routine that would not be out of place in a downtown strip club.

Dressed in a tight, black midriff-baring top, black leather hotpants and high black sandals, she flung herself around the pole and down on the floor, flicking her hair suggestively.

Some little boys can be seen laughing and swinging around each other, while the little girls in red majorette-style outfits in the front appear frozen still. Several mothers can be seen hurriedly shooing their children away from the scene.

""Who would think this is a good idea?"" Standaert asked above one of several videos he posted on Twitter.

""The principal hung up on my wife when she called after saying it was 'international and good exercise' ... OK, yeah for adults maybe, but not 3- to 6-year-old kids,"" he added.

There were also advertisements for a pole dancing school around the school courtyard, leading Standaert to wonder if the principal had accepted money in return for allowing the unusual display. He later said by email that he had not been able to confirm whether this was the case.

After the videos garnered lots of unwanted attention on the internet, the Bao'an educational bureau said the pole dance was ""inappropriate."" In a statement on Weibo, the Chinese answer to Twitter, the bureau asked the owner of the kindergarten to apologize to the parents and the public, and to sack the principal.

The principal of the kindergarten, Lai Rong, issued an apology, saying she thought ""inviting professional dancers to the kindergarten to perform for the parents would liven up the mood"" on the first day back. ""I did not think through the contents of the performance ... It was a very terrible viewing experience for the kids and the parents. For that, I sincerely apologize,"" according to a report on Weibo of her message to parents.

Lai told The Washington Post that she sent the apology even before the local education bureau got involved.

""I was thinking of asking the forgiveness from the parents and also promising them that we would not teach the kids this kind of dance. I just want the kids to know the existence of this kind of dance. That's all,"" she told The Post.

Many Weibo commentators said it was not an appropriate spectacle for a kindergarten. But not everyone disapproved.

""This is probably something to encourage the dads to pick up their kids,"" said Weibo user @Janson_Mou. ""If my daughter's kindergarten is like this, I will go pick her up every day.""

The idea of having pole dancers or strippers at an event not usually associated with exotic dancing is not entirely new in China.

In 2015, the Chinese Culture Ministry cracked down on the ""bizarre and increasingly popular"" habit of having half-naked women perform at funerals, which was ""corrupting the social atmosphere.""

""Having exotic performances of this nature at funerals highlights the trappings of modern life in China, whereby vanity and snobbery prevail over traditions,"" the state news agency, Xinhua, reported at the time.

The practice appeared part of a tactic to attract more mourners to funerals, make the deceased look more popular and honor their life more fully. In flashy New China, it's also become a way to flaunt newly gotten wealth.

China has had a tradition of entertaining mourners at funerals as far back as the Qing Dynasty, established in 1636. Some experts said that having exotic dancers at funerals - and at weddings - was a form of fertility worship. ""In some local cultures, dancing with erotic elements can be used to convey the deceased's wishes of being blessed with many children,"" Huang Jianxing, a professor in Fujian Normal University's sociology department, told the Global Times.

The most eye-popping example of the exotic funeral occurred in Taiwan last year, when 50 women in lingerie pole-danced on moving black cars at the funeral of politician Tung Hsiang.

The Chiayi County Council speaker ""enjoyed a buzz"" so the funeral was designed to give him ""a happy departure,"" his son said, according to reports.

The deceased was a Class VIII student at an ashram shala, a residential school run by the government for tribal children. A few months ago, the girl was allegedly asked by the school authorities to vacate her hostel room over her frequent unsanctioned visits to her family. Students are expected to stay in school hostels and leave for home only with written permission from the authorities, the police said.

The Government of Bihar has now ordered action against the principal of the school.

Vaishali District Magistrate Rajeev Roshan said that the reports of the caste-wise seating arrangement were found to be true, following which action was ordered against the principal.

According to a local source, the GA High School in Lalganj Vaishali, which has over 1,000 students enrolled in Classes IX and X, divided the students on the basis of their religion and caste and asked them to sit in separate classrooms accordingly. Their attendance registers also mention their caste along with their names, so as to ensure that all students stuck to the religion and caste-based division while sitting in the classrooms.

""The issue came to the fore when some students of the school raised an objection to the caste-based segregation, following which the district administration probed the matter and ordered action against the principal, Meena Kumari,"" the source added.

Kumari, in her defence, said she only continued with the seating plan decided by her predecessor as it was convenient to implement the various welfare schemes of the government if the students were seated accordingly. She also denied that the students had ever been discriminated due to their religion or caste.

The local officials of the education department have sent a detailed report on the matter to the senior officials for information and further recommendation.

The administration has also approved a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each for the families of the deceased students and the families are hopeful it will be transferred to them soon.

The incident occurred around 9.30 am on Monday in Salarpur village, while an exam was going on inside the school.

According to principal Jha's statement, the victims were standing outside to either use the washroom or to drink water. Since he was busy inside the school as examinations were going on, he didn't know the exact sequence of the event, said police officials.

Five children were trapped under the rubble of the boundary wall when it collapsed. All five had been rushed to nearby hospitals after they were extricated from the debris by the locals, the police and a team from NDRF.

Two of the students identified as Vivek Yadav (7) and Bhupendra Singh (11) died while three others were critically injured. One of the injured students was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday while the other two continue to recuperate.

According to police, construction work was in progress on the adjoining plot. The sand from the construction site was kept along the boundary wall of the school, which was about 10-feet high, and the weight of it allegedly weakened it thereby, leading to its collapse.

Police had registered an FIR against six persons, including the management of the school and the neighbour on whose plot the construction was taking place. The persons who have been booked are Amit and Sumit Bhati (owners), Deshraj Bhati (neighbouring plot owner), Sanjiv Jha (principal), Raghvendra Solanki (school manager) and the operator of the earthmover ( yet to be identified).

The FIR has been registered under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 338 (causing grievous hurt) and Section 75 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

Sector 49 police arrested Jha from home in sector 107. Jha was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.

""We are now on the lookout for the other accused who are absconding at the moment and we hope to nab them soon. We are working to trace their location using their phones,"" said Swetabh Pandey, circle officer 3, Noida police.","Noida wall collapse case: Principal held, fresh FIR filed for running school illegally","1021904630","2018-12-19","https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-wall-collapse-case-school-principal-held-fresh-fir-filed/story-EWDza2B2h5dzDDP1BAJHcM.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

"5926","","NOIDA: The principal of an unrecognised school in Salarpur village in Noida, where two Class 1 students were killed as a wall collapsed on them on Monday, was arrested a day after the tragic incident. However, the owner of the school, who identifies himself as a leader of Samajwadi Party's youth wing Yuvjan Sabha, is absconding.

The principal, Sanjeev Jha, an original resident of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, was arrested by Sector 49 police from near Arogyadhan Maharshi Ashram, Sector 107 on Tuesday.

While Amit Bhati, who identifies himself as the state secretary of Yuvjan Sabha, is the chairman and owner of KM Public School, his uncle Deshraj Bhati is the owner of the adjacent plot where an earthmover was levelling the land, resulting in the wall collapse.

The students were sitting near the wall in the open and writing an exam when the wall collapsed on them. While two students died, five others were injured.

So far, Sector 49 police has booked Amit Bhati, his uncle Deshraj Bhati, Deshraj's son Sumit Bhati, school manager Raghvendra Solanki, principal Sanjeev Jha and the unidentified driver of the earthmover.

Meanwhile, a visit to the spot indicates that Amit is well-known in the area. A board installed at the entry of the lane to his three-storey house reads: Amit Bhati, pradesh sachiv (state secretary), Samajwadi Party Yuvjan Sabha. He is also well-known as the owner of multiple properties in the village, most of which have been given on rent.

Since Monday morning, when the tragedy struck, Amit and his kin have gone missing while his house remains locked. ""They are not here. The family has gone missing since the incident,"" said a neighbour.

Asked whether Amit was active in the party's youth wing, Gajendra, a villager, told TOI that Amit was seen during different campaigns and activities of the party. ""You can see the board installed here right at the entry of the lane. The family belongs to the village and owns land here,"" he said, pointing to the board.

In the village, many don't want to talk about Amit and his family.

""We live in the building rented out by the family. They own many buildings here,"" said the aunt of one of the children who got injured in the wall collapse.

While the party has officially denied that Amit was a member, some leaders admitted that he had indeed been associated with the party's activities and had even participated in meetings of the Yuvajan Sabha in Noida prior to the disbanding of the youth outfit last year.

""He used to follow a cabinet minister from the state and was actively involved in the party prior to the feud between the Shivpal and Akhilesh factions,"" said a local leader.

Surendra Nagar, Rajya Sabha MP from the SP, told TOI that Amit does not hold even primary membership of the party. ""There are some people who tend to use the party's name. However, he is not even a primary member,"" he said.

According to villagers, the school had been running for the past years but its responsibility was handed over to Solanki and Jha on profit-sharing basis. The responsibility to manage the school was handed over to the duo after changing its name from Khajan memorial to KM Public School last year.

Meanwhile, the students who had been recuperating in two different hospitals are out of danger.

One of the children, Akash (9), who was seriously injured, underwent two surgeries at Yatharth hospital on Tuesday in his right leg and thigh and a rod has been inserted in his leg.

Akhilesh Kumar, father of seven-year-old Amit told TOI that the children -Amit, Naitik and Ashish -- are yet to recover from their injuries.

Justice Fateh Deep Singh's verdict, which upholds the Chandigarh district court's decision of asking the

school administrator to come and face charges under the Pocso Act, is meant to deter all those school managements that sit on child-abuse complaints.

The verdict says that the summoning orders of August 5, 2017 (issued by an additional sessions judge who is also judge of the special court) appear to have missed this material point. For the sake of justice, the high court deems it ""essential to exercise the powers under Section 482 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) and direct the court where the matter is pending to ensure that even the principal, who had the knowledge of this incident..., is not let off.""

Dismissing the petition of the school administrator against his summoning to face prosecution, justice Singh observed that since the matter was brought to the notice of the school authorities, the administrator's duty was to ensure due redress, in matters concerning child abuse especially. The court observed: ""He (the school administrator) cannot hide behind the facade of lack of knowledge or information.""

So that matters like these are not brushed under the carpet and the purpose of the Pocso Act is met by all means, the high court has said that the district magistrate and the UT director of school education must fulfil their obligations under UN convention and Section 43 (public awareness of the law) of the Pocso Act.","School principal to be party to child abuse case - Times of India","1009832113","2018-12-04","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/school-principal-to-be-party-to-child-abuse-case/articleshow/66929754.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"5940","","The state Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) laid a trap and managed to arrest a school principal from Udaipur red-handed while accepting a bribe as commission to allow children access to free milk. The man had been troubling a milk contractor and asking for commission for clearning his bills. The aggrieved party used to supply milk under the Annapurna scheme for school children. The ACB has registered a case and is investigating the school principal.

According to ACB sleuths, the accused principal has been identified as one Gamer Lal, a resident of Udaipur, currently posted as principal of government primary school at Tekri near Udaipur.

""Recently the Udaipur wing of the ACB received a complaint against the Principal. In his grievance, the complainant - identified as Hira Lal, a resident of Agarwal Colony at Udaipur - claimed he used to supply milk for the children studying at the primary school at Tekri,"" ACB officials investigating the case said. This was being done under the Annapurna Scheme floated by the Vasundhara Raje government under which schoolkids are provided with free milk.

However, over the past several weeks he had stopped receiving his payments for the milk supplied to the school. When the contractor approached the principal to inquire about the non-payment of his bills, the school principal demanded Hira Lal pay him Rs 8,500 as commission, instead of making the payment.

""The accused also assured him that once the money is handed over, he would clear all his bills,"" officials said. When several attempts at getting the principal to forego the commission failed, the complainant approached the ACB for help.

""After the complaint was registered, a bid to verify the same was initiated. When the demand was verified, it was decided to lay a trap and nab the man red-handed,' an official said. On Tuesday afternoon the ball was set rolling.

The complainant was handed over the commission money and sent to the principal's office. As soon as the money exchanged hands, the complainant gave a signal to the ACB sleuths who raided the school premises and nabbed the principal red-handed while he was collecting the money. A case under Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered in the matter and further action is being taken, the official said.","ACB arrests school principal from Udaipur seeking to milk kids' scheme","993830195","2018-11-14","https://www.dnaindia.com/jaipur/report-acb-arrests-school-principal-from-udaipur-seeking-to-milk-kids-scheme-2685519","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
"5941","","Ninety children kidnapped at a school in a troubled English-speaking region of Cameroon have been freed, officials said on Wednesday, revealing that in addition to 79 students whose abduction had already been announced, 11 schoolmates were seized last week.

All are enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon's Northwest Region -- one of two areas where surging anglophone separatist militancy has been met with a brutal crackdown by authorities.

Communications Minister Issa Bakary Tchiroma said ""all 79 students"" seized on Monday ""have been released,"" without giving details of the circumstances under which they were set free.

The students were kidnapped with their principal, a teacher and a driver, but Tchiroma said their fate was not yet clear.

Separately, the Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, said that 11 other pupils were taken on 31 October but they have now been freed.

News of their disappearance had been withheld to enable negotiations with the kidnappers, the church said.

It said the school, located on the outskirts of Bamenda where there is a negligible presence by the security forces, would remain shuttered ""until further notice"".

On Tuesday, a leading member of the church, Reverend Foki Samuel Forba, said he had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were not demanding a ransom but the closure of the school.

The kidnappings were the first such mass abductions seen in Cameroon and coincide with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.

The release was announced a day after Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya was sworn in for a seventh term in office.

A six-minute video seen by AFP on Monday, but which could not be confirmed independently, showed 11 boys apparently aged about 15 giving their identity and name of the school in English, and adding that they were abducted by the ""Amba Boys"" -- a name for anglophone separatists.

Unprecedented in Cameroon

Such mass kidnappings were previously unknown in Cameroon, though they are notorious in neighbouring Nigeria.

The Islamist group Boko Haram snatched more than 200 schoolgirls from Nigeria's Borno state town of Chibok in April 2014, sparking worldwide condemnation and the #FreeOurGirls movement on Twitter.

Some 107 girls have since been released or found, but the Islamist group abducted scores more schoolgirls from the neighbouring Yobe state in February this year.

Cameroon's Biya on Tuesday promised to pursue policies of decentralisation to address ""frustrations and aspirations"" in English-speaking regions.

It was his first public acknowledgement of resentments that have spilled over in the country's anglophone Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region.

In 2016, anger at perceived discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy fanned demands for autonomy in the anglophone regions.

But Biya refused any concessions and a year later, radicals declared an independent state -- the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" -- taking up arms soon after.

Separatists have since attacked troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other state symbols, prompting a severe official crackdown.

At the start of the school year in September, several secondary schools were attacked, a headmaster was killed and a teacher was badly wounded.

At least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in the year to September, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

More than 300,000 others have fled the violence, some crossing into neighbouring Nigeria.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking -- a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

"5944","","Mumbai: Observing that the 'ghastly and heinous' crime of rape puts a question mark on the future of the minor survivors, the Bombay High Court, last week upheld the conviction of a school professor and principal, who abetted the crime. The HC said the teachers were supposed to be the custodians and guardians of the minor girl but they committed the heinous crime.

A division bench of Justices Sambhaji Shinde and Ajay Gadkari said, ""In the present case though there is delay of about two months in lodging the FIR, considering the fact that the victim was minor girl at the relevant time the offence took place. The offence was committed by her teacher, who was supposed to be her custodian and guardian during school hours.""

""It also needs to be remembered that if such ghastly and heinous crime take place in the villages, it creates serious impact on the minds of the villagers and puts question marks on future of minor victim girls,"" the judges observed. The bench accordingly, upheld the conviction and 18-years rigorous imprisonment of professor - Datta Jadhav (43) and also the 16-years rigorous imprisonment of principal - Vanita Patil (56).

Both Jadhav and Patil were employees of a Zilla Parishad school in Raigad. They had petitioned the bench of Justice Shinde, challenging their conviction by a sessions court. According to the prosecution case, Jadhav had molested several minor girl students of his school by abusing his post as a professor. He had even raped a 12-year-old girl and had even clicked obscene photos of 13 minor girls of his school. These photographs were later recovered from Jadhav's cell phone.

As far as Patil is concerned, she was convicted by the sessions court for abetting the crime by pushing the minor girl inside a room, where Jadhav committed rape on the girl. It was learnt that Patil stood outside the room and ensured that no one enters the room until Jadhav comes out after raping the girl. She had even bolted the doors of the room.

To their defence, the convicted duo argued that no rape took place and they were falsely implicated and arrested under political pressure. They blamed the sarpanch of the survivor's village, who, the duo claimed had got the FIR registered against them.

Having considered the submissions, the bench trashed the argument saying, ""The victim was from a socio-economic backward village and it is a matter of common knowledge that such villagers had no courage to face such uncommon incidents, and so in such a situation they always try to take the help of known person in the village when they had to go to police station.""","Bombay High Court upholds conviction of school teacher, principal, who raped minor girl students","987320127","2018-11-06","https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/bombay-high-court-upholds-conviction-of-school-teacher-principal-who-raped-minor-girl-students/1390858","Free Press Journal",FALSE
"5945","","Cameroon: Armed separatists have kidnapped 78 students and their principal from a Presbyterian school in Nkwen village in Cameroon's northwest region on Monday.

According to Governor Deben Tchoffo, the kidnapping took place near Bamenda, the capital of the troubled English-speaking region late on Sunday.

The kidnapper, who call themselves Amba boys, have also released a video on social media.

In the video, the kidnappers were seeing forcing several students to reveal their names and the names of their parents. The children say they were kidnapped late on Sunday but they don't know where they are being held.

The men who identify themselves as the kidnappers say they will only release the children when they achieve what they want.

While the video could not be independently verified, parents have been reacting on social media saying they recognise their children in the video.

It comes after elections on October 7 that saw President Paul Biya, 85, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for 35 years, secure a seventh term in office.

Biya was credited with 71.3 percent of the vote, although the ballot was marred by allegations of widespread fraud, low voter turnout and violence. He takes his oath of office on Tuesday.

Around a fifth of Cameroon's 22 million people are English-speaking - a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.

Cameroon, once a German colony, was divided between Britain and France after World War I.

The French colony gained independence in 1960, becoming Cameroon. The following year, the British-ruled Southern Cameroons was amalgamated into it, giving rise to the Northwest and Southwest regions.

But resentment at perceived discrimination at the hands of the francophone majority, especially in education and the judiciary, began to build.

In 2016, demands for greater autonomy grew but met with a rebuff by Biya.

As radicals took ascendancy, the anglophone movement declared the creation of the ""Republic of Ambazonia"" in the Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region on October 1, 2017.

No country has recognised the self-declared state.

The separatists have gunned down troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other perceived symbols of the Cameroonian state.

The authorities have responded with a massive crackdown by police and troops.

At least 400 civilians have been killed this year as well as more than 175 members of the security forces, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.

According to UN figures, 246,000 people in the Southwest Region have fled their homes, and 25,000 have sought shelter in neighbouring Nigeria, many of them living hand-to-mouth in the forests.","78 students, principal kidnapped from school in Cameroon - Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly","987136688","2018-11-05","http://pragativadi.com/78-students-principal-kidnapped-from-school-in-cameroon/","pragativadi.com",FALSE

"5948","","The authorities of a premier college in Assam's Nagaon district have been accused of ""saffronising"" the college environment by asking the students to wear ""proper uniform"".

All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA Aminul Islam said in a Facebook post, ""There cannot be any harm if some girl students go to college in 'hijab' (veil worn by Muslim women) and 'niqab' (clothing that covers the face)"" as reported by TOI.

Responding to the allegation by the opposition leader, principal of Anandaram Dhekial Phookan (ADP) College Dr Surajit Kumar Bhagowati on Friday said he did not ban any religious outfit and only issued a notice before the Autumn vacation asking students to wear ""proper uniform"".

He further added that out of the 20 per cent Muslim students of the college, only the MLA's daughter wears a burqa in college. He was feeling threatened and has lodged a police complaint over the Facebook post of the AIUDF leader, the principal said.

On being asked whether he has banned 'hijab' and 'niqab' in the college, the principal said he neither ordered any such ban nor did he ask any student not to wear burqa in the campus.

The MLA, a former student of the ADP College, asked in the post written in Assamese, ""Is the college your paternal property? What was so bothersome about a few students attending the college wearing 'hijab' or 'niqab'? Does wearing decent clothes affect the college environment?""

The college's Students Union and the Teachers' Council have criticised the MLA for the social media post. The Muslim students have also come out in support of the move of the principal.

They said before journalists that if students of different religious communities insist on coming in their respective outfits to the institute, the secular environment of the college will be vitiated.","Burqa Politics: Assam MLA Accuses Principal Of 'Saffronisation' Even As Minority Students Support School's 'Proper Uniform' Policy ","981102453","2018-10-29","https://swarajyamag.com/insta/burqa-politics-assam-mla-accuses-principal-of-saffronisation-even-as-minority-students-support-schools-proper-uniform-policy","swarajyamag.com",FALSE

Three former students of a Catholic school in Chandigarh have levelled sexual harassment charges against the former principal and co-founding director of the school on social media.

Harold Carver, who is the principal of the school has been accused of sexual harassment by Manraj Singh.

Manraj, a student of the 1980 batch, has called Carver a sexual predator on his Facebook page. He said that he and his hostel mates were aware of the principal's activities. He mentioned that he was a Class 7 student when the accused called him to his office and initiated an uncomfortable conversation with him.

Earlier, a 42-year-old Delhi based journalist Sanjay Austa had accused Harold Carver of sexually harassing him and his hostel mates when he was a student in the school. Austa had said in his blog that he was a Class 9 student when Carver abused him in his office.

""Harold Carver is a sexual predator whose choice was children. Ever since I learnt that Harold Carver was back in Chandigarh, I started getting worried. How many children would he have abused in his entire career? How many like me who knew he was a pedophile were silenced? How many kids couldn't have walked out of his office the way I did that day,"" said Sanjay Austa.

Another former student Navin Chhetri, who is currently in Colorado, US, has also accused Harold of sexual harassment.

However, it is not for the first time that Harold has been accused of sexual harassment by his students. Carver was also sentenced to prison for one month 30 years ago for allegedly abusing half a dozen students. Navin Chhetri, who was one of the students had also appeared in the court. The complaint was later withdrawn.

The school management has refuted the allegations against Harold Carver saying that he is a ""man of intense integrity"" and accusations levelled against him are false, baseless and extremely hurtful.

Harold Carver has also termed the allegations as baseless.

""I have an unblemished record and cannot even imagine committing such an act. I sanguinely feel that the whole game is to malign the reputation of the school,"" Harold Carver said.

To execute the robbery, the masked assailants thrashed the school security guard, Karamjit Singh, and tied him to a chair with his own turban. Then, they threatened the guard with their gun, took the office key from him, and went inside.

The school authorities came to know about the incident in the morning when the security guard of the morning shift reached the school and found the night guard tied to a chair. The police have scanned CCTVs installed in the school premises, in which seven miscreants were captured.

Karamjit said he was present at the gate when six miscreants barged in the school after scaling the compound wall from the school's rearside. Meanwhile, one of the accused had knocked at the main gate to distract him. ""When I went near the door to see who was knocking it, six other miscreants, who had already entered the school, attacked me with iron rods and sharp-edged weapons.

"5967","","BENGALURU: A 64-year-old president-cum-principal of a private school here was stabbed to death by a gang of six men who barged into his office with knives on Sunday morning. The reason is said to be a property dispute. Ironically, the victim, Ranganath Nayaka, had gone to the school to discuss the same issue with a local leader who offered to mediate.

The attack took place around 10 am in Havanur Public School in Agrahara Dasarahalli on Magadi Road. About five hours later, the police were able to trace the main attacker Muniraju alias Babli in Mahalakshmi Layout, where they were forced to open fire at him and nab him. The rest are absconding. The dispute pertains to a building owned by one Gangamma on a site adjacent to the school, which had encroached upon the school property. The encroaching part of the building was demolished by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) two days ago based on a court order.

Ranganath Nayaka, a resident of Housing Board Colony near Rajajinagar, has retired as assistant manager at RBI. Nayaka owned the school, which he set up in 2003 after he retired. The family hails from Pavagada in Tumakuru district and had settled in the city. A police officer said the incident took place when Nayaka and the school's administrative staff were at a meeting with a local leader, Rajashekar, to resolve the same property dispute.

Lokesh Gowda, an employee, and Yathish, an assistant, rushed to Nayaka's rescue, but the duo too was attacked by the gang which then fled the scene. The attackers included Gangamma's two sons. Gowda and Yathish sustained stab injuries. Lokesh Gowda said, ""The gang stabbed Nayaka in his chest, thigh and stomach.""

Preliminary investigation has revealed that a portion of a residential building belonging to one Gangamma, located next to the school, had encroached upon the school property. Nayaka had approached the court over the encroachment as it was creating a problem for the school. The court had ordered demolition of the encroaching portion and BDA officials had demolished it with police protection two days ago.

Gangamma's sons Prasad and Mahesh had reportedly nurtured a grudge against Nayaka over the demolition and had allegedly planned to kill him.

Prasad along with his gang came and allegedly attacked Nayaka in his chamber, stabbing him to death.

Babli, who was among the first to attack, was arrested within five hours of the murder, while Prasad, Mahesh and three others are absconding. The police have formed a special team to nab them, a police officer said. ""We are yet to ascertain whether Babli and his gang had taken any 'supari' contract from Prasad to kill Nayaka,"" an investigation officer added.

Nayaka's elder brother Nagendraiah told The New Indian Express that Gangamma had passed away recently after which her two sons Prasad and Mahesh got into a dispute with Nayaka over the encroachment.

He said Rajashekhar, a local leader, who was also known to Prasad and Mahesh, had offered to mediate between the two parties to resolve the dispute. ""My brother was being called to the school since two days. But he could not go as he had undergone an eye surgery a week ago. On Sunday he sought the doctor's advice before going to the school,"" Nagendariah said.","Six men barge into Bengaluru school, stab principal to death","969595279","2018-10-15","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2018/oct/15/six-men-barge-into-bengaluru-school-stab-principal-to-death-1885620.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

The order by the Joint Director Education noted that chairman of the school should present himself at the office of the department in Srinagar on Wednesday and warned of strict action against the school in case he fails to attend the hearing. Besides the chairman, parents association of the school has also been asked to reach the department on Wednesday.

The order said that a delegation of parents of students at Hat Trick school had approached the department ""with regard to redressal of their genuine grievances"".

A delegation of parents had met the school authorities at the DESK and brought to their notice the violation of rules in denying them the information about the fee and annual charges which have been approved by the authorities. The notice by the Education department to the school came also in the wake of the complaints that the school was forcing the parents to buy the books from a particular shop to indulge in profiteering.

"6267","","But using the systems in schools has raised privacy concerns and last year hundreds of channels livestreaming classroom surveillance footage online was shut down.

A Chinese high school is using facial recognition technology to monitor and analyze students' behaviour.

The technology scans classrooms at Hangzhou No. 11 High School every 30 seconds and records students' facial expressions, categorizing them into happy, angry, fearful, confused or upset. The system also records student actions such as writing, reading, raising a hand, and sleeping at a desk.

The school's vice principal said students' privacy is protected because the technology doesn't save actual images from the classroom and stores data on a local server rather than the cloud.

Last year Chinese company Qihoo 360 shut down hundreds of its surveillance livestreaming channels after an uptick in privacy concerns. The channels streamed camera footage from several public locations including swimming pools, restaurants, and classrooms - the latter protected only by a password.

But security systems are rising in popularity after an increase in violence and questionable practices at Chinese kindergartens. In Beijing, all kindergartens are now required to have surveillance systems, some of which are even connected to local police monitoring systems.

The use of facial-recognition technology is soaring in China, where it is being used to increase efficiency and improve policing. Cameras are used to catch jaywalkers, find fugitives, track people's regular hangouts, and even predict crime before it happens.","A school in China is monitoring students with facial recognition technology that scans the classroom every 30 seconds","871795052","2018-05-21","https://www.businessinsider.in/a-school-in-china-is-monitoring-students-with-facial-recognition-technology-that-scans-the-classroom-every-30-seconds/articleshow/64250750.cms","businessinsider.in",FALSE
"6268","","China has been going big with civilian surveillance recently, primarily using facial recognition in everything from traffic cameras, to smart glasses for police officers, and more. Now, there's a new target in Big Brother's crosshairs, and that's China's kids.

According to government run website Hangzhou.com, a school in the city has taken to facial recognition to keep students attentive in class. Three cameras have supposedly been installed above a blackboard at Hangzhou Number 11 High School in eastern China. The facial recognition system captures seven expressions, neutral, happy, sad, disappointed, angry, scared and surprised. It then uses these to determine whether each child is paying attention to the lesson, and feeds the data back to the teacher if they're not.

So far the system has been installed in just one classroom, but it's expected to be used by the entire school within a few months. ""Previously when I had classes that I didn't like very much, I would be lazy and maybe take a nap on the desk or flick through other textbooks,"" one student told Hangzhou.com. ""But I don't dare be distracted since the cameras were installed in the classrooms. It's like a pair of mystery eyes are constantly watching me.""

Obviously, the system has met with criticism from some groups, but the school principal said he believes it'll improve the standard of education being provided. ""It's the same as teachers having an assistant, and it can improve the quality of teaching,"" he said. """"Some have said it can infringe the privacy of students, but it only records students' movements, rather than filming activities in class.""

Worryingly though, he let on a rudimentary system of classification the system has, marking attentive students with an 'A' and others with a 'B'. It's probably only a matter of time before that system is used to segregate students into attentive and distracted classes, with those unable to keep up likely being saddled with extra study hours and the like.","A Chinese School Is Using Facial Recognition To Make Sure Kids Are Paying Attention In Class","870686358","2018-05-18","https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/news/a-chinese-school-is-using-facial-recognition-to-make-sure-kids-are-paying-attention-in-class-345663.html","indiatimes.com",FALSE

The administration at the St Gee Varghese Public School issued SLCs to students of Mother Marry Public School in Mandawali and New Indraprastha Public School located in East Vinod Nagar, according to a DoE official.

The release said the two other schools are recognised only till class V, while students who were provided the SLCs were studying in Classes VI-VIII. Officials of the Directorate of Education (DoE) said the two schools were illegally running classes up to class X, while they were recognised only up to Class V by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation. This case came to light after a complaint against the school was filed by one Joginder Singh. The complaint explained how the school provided SLCs to students of other schools. It also stated that building of the school is in a bad condition and no classes are being run in this school at the recognized premises. The third point in the complaint stated, ""the Registration of the Society has been cancelled by the Deputy Commissioner of Industries (Societies) on 28.04.2015.""

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has withdrawn recognition of an east Delhi school for allegedly indulging in forgery and issuing school leaving certificates (SLCs) to students of two other schools that have recognition only till Class V.

DoE officials said St Gee Varghese Public School in Kalyanvas was allegedly issuing SLCs to students studying in classes VI-VIII of two schools -- Mother Marry Public School in Mandawali, and New Indraprastha Public School, East Vinod Nagar. Officials said both schools, recognised only up to Class V by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, have been illegally running classes up to Class X.

School authorities could not be reached for comment on the matter. The DoE has withdrawn recognition -- granted in 1989-90 -- from this academic session and has advised parents not to approach the school for admissions. The action was taken by the department following a complaint by a resident, Joginder Singh. In his complaint, Singh claimed that St Gee Varghese Public School's building was in a poor state and was not running from the same building for which it had got recognition.

Section 55 of the Delhi School Education Act & Rules (DSEAR), 1973, states that prior approval from the DoE is required before shifting the school to a new location: ""If a recognised school ceases to function; or is shifted to a different locality; or is transferred to a different trust, society, individual or a group of individuals; without previous approval of the appropriate authority, its recognition shall lapse on such censer, shifting or transfer, as the case may be... It shall, for the purpose of future recognition, be treated as a new school.""

In 2014, officials said the district education office had conducted an inquiry against the school. An inquiry committee found that the school, in its records, had shown ghost employees as well as students, and that there was just one attendance register for students from nursery to Class VIII. The DoE issued a showcause notice to the school management in 2017 to explain the anomalies. While the school had denied the other allegations, it said that the building was in poor shape and required repair. Hence, a nearby building was taken on rent and students of classes VI-VIII were shifted there.

""The school violated many provisions of the DSEAR. We have been conducting an inquiry since 2014. Despite issuing a showcause notice, the school failed to comply.

The school had come to limelight in March 2017, when the Class XII students of this school did not get their roll numbers for board exams.

DEO Anujit Kaur said, ""We have proposed that the recognition be withdrawn for classes XI and XII from the next academic session (2018-19)."" The copy of the letter sent on January 9 is with TOI.

The education department had formed a committee and conducted an inquiry. In the letter, DEO has referred to the committee's report and stated, ""There is total mismanagement of the records and lots of anomalies are visible in the admission process.""

The letter further adds that the school authorities had not informed the parents of the students regarding the norms for the classes and ruined the precious time of their life by misguiding them. It was further stated that, ""There is malpractice found in general administration of the school.""

The report was submitted by the committee last year and had proposed to review the recognition of the school with effect from March 31, 2018 and also, to review the affiliation from CBSE.

A showcause notice was issued to the principal and keeping in view the reply, the education department had first written to CBSE to withdraw the affiliation but the board had written back asking the education department to withdraw the recognition first. This was reported by TOI in July 2017.

Thereafter, the department had again written to the school and, the DEO has once again written to DSE to ""withdraw the recognition of the school of senior secondary level from the current academic year (2018-19).""

The letter reads proposed officials have already informed the school verbally to not admit students in Class XI and XII in the new session. The school has also been warned that if anomalies are found in class X result this year then the school will be downgraded further to lower level.

Yet again this year, education received the highest allocation (26.3%) in the Delhi Budget, with funds being allocated to install 150-200 CCTVs in each school and to develop a ranking system for government schools. Allocation increased from last year's Rs 11,300 crore to Rs 13,997 crore in Thursday's budget.

Stressing on the need to keep students safe, Finance Minister Manish Sisodia said 1.2 lakh CCTV cameras will be installed across government schools. ""An outlay of Rs 175 crore has been proposed in the budget estimate 2018-19. About 150-200 cameras will be installed in each school building. Parents will now be able to see classroom activities of their children online,"" Sisodia said. The plan was announced in the last budget but was not implemented as it remained stuck in the tendering process.

Rs 15 crore for ranking government schools will be given to the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights. ""Parents are concerned about the safety of their wards. They don't have access to authentic information on quality of education, environment and facilities in schools. We are bringing a new scheme under which every school will be evaluated...,"" he said.

Continuing the scheme to strengthen school management committees, the bodies will be given a Rs 5 lakh budget to purchase books for libraries, teaching aids, etc.

The proposals, though, came under criticism.

"6297","","Mumbai: Amid increasing reports of minors being subjected to sexual assault on school premises in Navi Mumbai, the the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) will soon instal Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras at all 70 of its civic schools. The move is on the heels of a police recommendation that schools be under CCTV surveillance as a precautionary measure.

The importance of this security measure on school premises was brought home by the alleged rape of a nine-year-old girl inside the toilet of her school in Vashi in September. The victim confided to her mother about the incident. She said, an unidentified person took her to a toilet after covering her mouth with a handkerchief and raped her. The incident took place as she was entering school. Since there were no CCTV cameras installed in the school, the accused was never identified.

Meanwhile, police will send notices to schools to take precautions to ensure the safety of students on the premises. Sudhakar Pathare, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 1), said, ""Apart from requesting schools to instal CCTV cameras, we have also asked schools to hire guards from certified security agencies, who can keep a record of people entering and leaving the school.""

DCP Pathare added, school management and staff should also ensure the CCTV footage be retained for at least a week, and not just for 24 hours, as is usually the practice. NMMC Commissioner N Ramaswamy said this proposal was tabled in the committee in March and the project is underway. ""At this juncture, the project is at tendering stage. All civic schools in the city will be under CCTV surveillance by the end of this financial year. Each school will be installed with CCTV cameras after thorough individual survey. The results of the survey will determine the number of cameras required per school.""

Explaining how installation of CCTV surveillance costs as low as Rs 14 per student, parents will not mind paying a minimal amount to ensure the safety and security of their children. Lopes Diago, Principal of St Xavier's School in Nerul said, ""Our schools are well-equipped with CCTV surveillance. Lack of funds cannot be an excuse for not having one.

Installation of CCTV cameras in government schools, a new survey to ascertain the level of safety for women in public spaces, and hikes in assistance to Residents' Welfare Associations (RWAs) and leprosy patients were among the proposals passed by the Delhi Cabinet on Tuesday.

At a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Cabinet passed the Education Department's proposal for administrative approval and expenditure sanction for installing CCTV cameras in government schools, a government statement said.

In May, the Expenditure Finance Committee had approved the ₹597 crore project to instal 1.46 lakh cameras in schools, including inside classrooms. The cameras will cover classrooms, corridors, laboratories, libraries, vacant rooms, parking lots and areas outside washrooms.

The government had decided to instal cameras in schools after a spate of attacks on children inside institutes across the NCR in the past year. In July, the Cabinet had approved a project to instal 1.4 lakh cameras in Delhi's residential colonies and markets.

In order to map the city for infrastructural problems, a proposal by the Women and Child Development Department to conduct a survey with the NGO SafetiPin was approved by the Cabinet, the statement said.

The NGO had done a survey to identify dark spots a few years ago, the statement added. The new survey will involve collection of data on the level of brightness, visibility, number of pedestrians, presence of security or police personnel, condition of footpath, availability of public transport and percentage of women and children in the crowd at different locations in the city.

This information will be crowd-sourced using two apps created by SafetiPin.

The Cabinet also approved the Environment and Forest Department's proposal to double the amount of financial assistance, from ₹1 lakh per acre to ₹2 lakh per acre, to RWAs and NGOs to maintain parks.

The Cabinet also cleared a proposal to give one-time assistance of ₹2 lakh per acre for the setting up of a sewage treatment plant (STP) at parks maintained by the RWAs or NGOs. The STP will draw sewage from the nearest line of the Delhi Jal Board, treat it and then enable the use of the grey water to irrigate the park.

The Cabinet also cleared the Education Department's proposal to rename the existing Vidyalaya Kalyan Samiti scheme to School Management Committee (SMC) Fund in order to empower the SMCs. The Cabinet also approved the department's proposal to increase the rates of remuneration of guest teachers that fall in the ""miscellaneous"" subject category, including music and special education.

The Social Welfare Department's proposal to increase the financial assistance to leprosy patients from ₹1,800 a month to ₹3,000 a month under the Rehabilitation Centre for Leprosy Affected Persons (RCL) Scheme was also approved.

The state department of primary and secondary education has decided to install CCTV cameras in a phased manner following instructions from Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy.

In the first phase, over 3,000 high schools will get CCTVs at an estimated total cost of Rs 10 crore. Priority will be given to schools with more number of girl students.As per the decision, each school would get four CCTV cameras, and officials at the local level and the head of the school will decide the spots based on strategic locations and their sensitivity.

He then directed the principal secretary of the department to take necessary measures to install CCTVs,"" said an official.

Installation of CCTVs at all schools across the states was made compulsory in the year 2017 following increasing incidents of sexual harassment and child abuse on school children. However, there was an objection from private school managements for not applying this to government schools.""It is not that government schools have been exempted from installing CCTVs.

"6306","","Civic school in Navi Mumbai do not have CCTV cameras on their premises.(HT FILE)

After the alleged rape of a nine-year-old girl inside the toilet of her school in Vashi last week, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has decided to install CCTV cameras at all civic schools run by them. The task will be finished by end of this financial year, a senior officer said.

Installation of CCTV cameras in school premises was the topic of discussion in the satellite city last after the alleged rape of a minor girl came to light.

The girl said that an unidentified person took her to a toilet by covering her mouth with a handkerchief when she was entering her school and raped her inside it.

The private school had no CCTV camera and hence the police have not been able collect concrete evidences against anyone.

After the incident, parents had also staged a protest and asked the school authorities to install CCTV cameras on the premises.

Ramaswamy N, commissioner of NMMC, said, ""At beginning of this financial year, we had decided to install CCTV cameras on the premises of our schools. The project is in tendering process. We can say that all civic schools in the city will be under CCTV surveillance by end of this financial year.""

NMMC runs a total of 70 schools of which 53 are primary and 17 are secondary schools.

When asked about the number of cameras each school will get, Ramaswamy said, ""Individual surveys will be conducted at each school and the number of required cameras will be decided based on that. We will ensure the entire premises is covered.""

Meanwhile, the city police are sending notices to private schools to take precautionary measures to ensure safety of students on the premises.

Installation of CCTV cameras was one of the measures mentioned in the notice.

Sudhakar Pathare, deputy commissioner of police (zone 1), said, ""Apart from installing such cameras, we have asked the schools to hire guards from certified security agencies. They should also keep record of people who enter their compound.""

""Likewise, the school authorities should preserve the CCTV feed for a longer time as it may help in investigations,"" he said.

When asked if the police would take action if schools do not follow the guidelines, Pathare said, ""We cannot take any action under Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure or the Mumbai Police Act. The education department of NMMC will have to the action.""

Activists and parents of civic school students are happy with the civic body's decision.

Parshuram Rumale, 42, a parent of a child who studies in the Vashi school where the minor was raped, said, ""When a school has CCTV cameras, miscreants normally get scared to enter its compound. Every school should install such cameras.""

Ramesh Bhagat, 39, a parent of a child who studies in a Nerul school, said, ""Apart from cases like sexual assault, parents allege that kids are beaten up by teachers . If every classroom has CCTV cameras, there will never be such confusion.""

Sudhir Dani, 50, an education activist, said children's safety is more important than analysis of the existing rules.

""If something goes wrong inside the school, it's bad for the school too. Therefore, the schools should take it as their moral responsibility to install CCTV cameras,"" said Dani.

Father S Almeida, principal of Father Agnel Multipurpose School and Junior College, Vashi, said, ""We have installed CCTV cameras on the entire premises. They are monitored from the principal's room. It's not easy for a student to go out of the premises during school hours.""

""We also keep conducting workshops for our staff and ask them to treat the students with right manners. Thus, within our parameter, we have taken all precautionary measures. However it's tough to say that nothing can happen,"" he said.

An official from St Xavier's School in Nerul said, ""Lack of fund cannot be an excuse for not having CCTV surveillance.

The suggestions came against the backdrop of the alleged rape of a nursery student in a prominent school in Greater Noida. The administration has set up a five-member panel to examine security measures for students at the school. ADM (administration) Kumar Vineet, who is heading the committee, had invited suggestions from parents, who met him at the district collectorate on Tuesday.

""No area, classroom, hallway, auditorium, swimming pool, should be excluded from CCTV coverage. CCTV coverage should specifically cover entrance areas outside washrooms, changing rooms and rest rooms and the archive of this footage should be preserved for a minimum period of six months,"" the letter handed to the ADM states.

The parents also sought a welfare council headed by an elected group of parents who would be able to take decisions and view CCTV footage of cameras installed in schools. ""The management should ensure CCTV footage is monitored real time and parents given access to it. As of now, many of the parents are not even allowed to enter the school premises, leave alone viewing CCTV footage,"" said a parent of a Class IV child.

The parents' group has also requested that they be allowed to conduct random checks in schools. They suggested that extra-curricular activities, such as swimming and horse riding, be made optional.

The ADM said some of the suggestions, such as constituting a parent's welfare council and a safety audit, would be sent to the boards concerned for issuing guidelines to the respective schools.","Allow us to see CCTV feed of schools: Parents - Times of India","912152331","2018-07-25","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/allow-us-to-see-cctv-feed-of-schools-parents/articleshow/65125597.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"6311","","Says idea of constant surveillance needs further deliberation

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the AAP government to explain the reasons and circumstances behind its proposal to install over 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras in State-run schools.

A Bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C. Hari Shankar posed the query while hearing a petition seeking direction to the authorities to not put CCTV cameras inside the classrooms.

While agreeing that the issue brought up by advocate Jai Dehadrai was ""something to look into"", the Bench wondered if the argument for right to privacy of the children will apply, if CCTVs are placed inside classrooms.

Effect on children

The Bench noted that ""the whole idea of being under constant surveillance or scrutiny"" and its effect on the children needed further deliberation.

The Delhi government, represented by Additional Standing Counsel Sanjoy Ghosh, argued that schools in most of the first-world countries have cameras inside classrooms and school campus for safety reasons.

Mr. Dehadrai told the court that it was not healthy to have cameras inside classrooms where children, including girls, often discuss personal things amongst themselves. He also said the constant scrutiny by cameras in a classroom would have a psychological impact on the children apart from raising concerns of voyeurism and stalking.

The petitioner, Daniel George, in his plea has contended that installing cameras without any regulatory mechanism on access to its footage could lead to incidents of stalking and molestation.","HC asks AAP govt to give reasons behind CCTV proposal in schools","903834318","2018-07-11","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-asks-aap-govt-to-give-reasons-behind-cctv-proposal-in-schools/article24393849.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

Attendance should be marked thrice a day, and if a student is found missing, parents should be informed immediately through a text message, the circular said.

No student should be punished in such a way that he or she would suffer a mental or physical trauma, it said.

The guidelines also restrict entry of unidentified persons on the school premises.

Character certificate from police would be mandatory for recruitment as teachers or other staff at educational institutions.

Washrooms for boys and girls should be separate and at a suitable distance from each other, and there should be a woman attendant at the girls' washroom, the guidelines say.

The woman attendant on school bus should not leave the bus until the last girl is dropped, the guidelines add.

The guidelines will apply to state board schools as well as those affiliated to CBSE, ICSE and international boards.

They would come into effect from the coming academic year.

"6320","","NOIDA: The education department has directed schools affiliated to UP Madhyamik Shiksha Board to install CCTV cameras in rooms where finals exams will be held from February 6.

The district inspector of schools (DIOS) has ordered that all the 45 examination examination centres under the board must have the cameras by January 15.

Many schools have sighted lack of funds under the development category for their inability to buy the CCTV cameras. Sources said the DIOS had asked such schools to take a written undertaking from him allowing them to use funds under other heads to install the cameras as early as possible.

""A similar directive had been issued earlier but it was not mandatory. The board has now made it mandatory for test centres to have CCTV cameras. On Friday, fresh directives were issued at a meeting of all school inspectors with the education minister and senior officials of the board. We had called another meeting of the principals on Saturday and informed them about the decision,"" said PK Upadhyay, the DIOS of Gautam Budh Nagar.

Officials said the decision to install the cameras followed several complaints of copying during exams and imposters writing the papers on behalf of the actual examinees.

A similar order issued two years ago was hardly implemented in the absence of a clarity on funds.

Most test centres of the UP board fall in Jewar and Greater Noida, where many schools do not have CCTV facility in examination rooms.

""We have started contacting the CCTV service providers. It has been clarified that the schools can use the development funds for getting CCTVs. However, if the development funds are not sufficient, the DIOS has said that he can give an undertaking to utilise the money under other heads,"" said Ashok Dwivedi, the principal of Shri Amichand Inter College, Kasna.

The principal of a government school in Jewar said generating funds was easier said than done for schools that did not have their own land and building and relied mostly on fees from students to function.

The department has also directed the principals to hand over to the police any person found writing the paper on behalf of the actual examinee.

""Such complaints had been made around two years back from a private school in Maaycha village. There have been instances when students have influenced principals and got others to write the exams for them. They will now be handed over to the police immediately and the principals do not have to wait for an FIR to be lodged against them,"" the DIOS said.","UP board schools told to hold exams under CCTV watch - Times of India","789669100","2018-01-07","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/up-board-schools-told-to-hold-exams-under-cctv-watch/articleshow/62407256.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"6322","","Mumbai: Schools run by Maharashtra government have raised the issue of lack of funding by the state. This has forced schools to depend on their managements which has resulted in appointment of temporary teachers on contract basis, accept donations and increase the tuition fees.

School authorities are facing difficulties in managing on daily basis due to lack of funds. The state funds help schools to pay salaries of the teachers and maintenance of school building, conduct repair, help pay electricity and water bills, stationery, purchase furniture and facilitate administrative work. In addition, in the funds given by the state, schools can conduct extra activities and manage new boards or curriculum.

A principal of a Bandra school said, ""We have been asking our management to give us more finance just to pay basic electricity and maintenance bills. The management in turn gets this money through donations and well-wishers or senior alumnus members. Nobody wants to talk about these issues openly, as ultimately we are government-aided schools and do not want our children to suffer, or be forced to shut down our schools.""

The state recently declared it will fill all vacant posts of teachers in junior colleges, but principals have questioned when does the state plan filling vacant posts in schools and tackling the phenomenon of temporary teachers. Shubhdha Gorge, a teacher of St Thomas High School, said, ""We are being hired on contract basis for a temporary period. The school does not have the ability to hire us as permanent staff, because they do not have sufficient funds to pay our salaries. How long can we work as temporary staff for a minimal salary?""

One fall out of this financial crunch is, school authorities are forced to increase tuition fees. A principal of Andheri School, said, ""We are left with no option but to increase the fees of students to pay the bills and keep our school running. Then we have the Fee Regulation Authority (FRA), which enforces its rules on us and keeps a tab. This leaves us in a fix and we do not know what to do.""

"6323","","PORVORIM: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who holds the education portfolio, on Tuesday announced his intention to implement the neighbourhood school concept in Goa which would make it mandatory for schools to grant admission to children from all sections of society living within a specific proximity to the educational institution.

Addressing legislators during the discussion on demand for grants for the education department, Parrikar said that once the neighbourhood school concept was properly implemented, ""no school will shut down and no case of denied admission will be found"".

Parrikar justified his decision by saying that there were sufficient educational institutions in the state to cater to all areas. He claimed that ""Goa is a saturated state with respect to schools"".

""I will not permit new schools to open... So the question of medium of instruction is not a serious problem. Around 2-3 schools have been given permission but those are in Konkani and Marathi and because there were no schools in a 2-3km radius in those locations. Today, one can find schools within 1-2 km,"" he said.

The minister said that schools would have to abide with the neighbourhood school concept as it would be one of the conditions for grant-in-aid from the government.

He said some relaxations would be made for parents who want to admit their children to a school where an elder sibling is already studying. ""If a sibling or if the parent has studied in a particular school, the school will have a quota for such admissions,"" Parrikar said.

He said that norms surrounding the implementation of the concept would be made ""clear before the next academic year starts"". He added, ""We will be forceful. Only for higher secondary, the range will be bigger.""

The education minister also said that the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) was in the process of developing a mobile app that would allow teachers in government schools to inform the government if any school equipment was broken or in need of maintenance.","Soon, schools will be forced to admit 'neighbour' kids: CM Manohar Parrikar - Times of India","916949675","2018-08-01","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/soon-schools-will-be-forced-to-admit-neighbour-kids-cm/articleshow/65219682.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"6325","","CHENNAI: Despite mushrooming of private schools and a steady migration of students from government schools, there has been a drop in number of new school buses registered. The numbers have almost halved in the past five years with educational institutions shying away from buying and registering new vehicles to transport students.

Attributing the drop in new buses to a lack of interest from parents, R Vishalakshi, president of the Tamil Nadu Private Matriculation Schools Association, said parents expect school buses to halt at their doorstep. School buses usually take a roundabout route whereas private vehicles pick up and drop students at their doorsteps, she said. ""This is why parents prefer private vehicles though they are expensive. We need to buy small buses to meet this demand but adding new vehicles to the existing fleet is not viable,"" she said.

Usually, schools collect Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000 as transportation fee per annum from students. The amount is no big deal for an institution which collects Rs 70,000 to Rs 1,50,000 as tuition fees. ""Why take the risk for such a small amount?"" said the principal of a city-based CBSE school.

With schools cutting down bus fleets, parents are forced to depend on private modes of transport that are unregulated and often unsafe to send their children school. Recalling an incident when an LKG girl was kidnapped by a private cab driver at R A Puram in 2013, S Arumainathan, state president of the Tamil Nadu Students Parents Welfare Association, said either the police or the transport department should create new rules to regulate vehicles transporting school children.

""The schools have absolved themselves of the responsibility to transport students. But they should note down the name of the private transporter to ensure safety of their students,"" Arumainathan said.

An auto or cab driver earns Rs 3,000 to Rs 8,000 per month by ferrying students every day. But for that he has to overload the vehicle. The traffic police have booked thousands of cases against private vehicles for such offences.

""It is not profitable if we transport three or four school children per trip. Only by accommodating at least eight students we will be able to compensate for the drop in revenue through regular trips because of increased fuel prices and app-based taxis,"" said V Chandran from the auto-drivers union of CITU in Chennai. Chandran said the driver usually resides in the same area from where he picks up and drops the students. He wins the trust of the parents for two reasons -- they know him personally and he gives individual attention to the children. If the classes are delayed, an autodriver waits and brings them back home, said Chandran.

Private schools have often cited strict design norms for buses -- mandated for safety of the students and hence demanded by transport department inspectors -- push up costs. But rejecting such claims, a transport official said schools need not alter buses to meet safety standards as manufacturers have started to produce models which meet the standards.

""Though the rejection rate due to defects in floor boards, doors and steps is high at first round of inspection, almost all vehicles make necessary corrections and start operation in the month of July or August,"" an official said.

Inspection for the forthcoming academic year is due next week.","Schools say no to new buses, kids forced to take risky rides - Times of India","859337179","2018-04-30","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/schools-say-no-to-new-buses-kids-forced-to-take-risky-rides/articleshow/63964838.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

""Out of 195 private schools, 128 have informed the directorate of education that they are rolling back their hiked fees. The move will benefit 2.03 lakh students studying at these 128 schools. Remaining 67 private schools will soon be served showcause notices for not complying with the orders,"" a government spokesperson said.

He said that the government believes in the co-existence of private and the government schools but the arbitrary fee hike had been a cause of concern.

An official at the CM's office said that the government in April issued directions to schools after being flooded with complaints from parents regarding ""arbitrary"" fee hike.

""Checking the arbitrary hike in school fees is one of the main promises of this government. It has been successful in not letting the schools increase their fees arbitrarily and in the past several schools had to return increased fees to the parents after government's intervention,"" the government official said.

The official said that education minister Manish Sisodia would meet the representatives of all the 128 schools who had complied with the government's directive and discuss how to take forward the education system in Delhi.

"6338","","NEW DELHI: As many as 128 private schools in the city against whom there were complaints of arbitrary fee hikes have rolled back their fees, the Delhi government said on Thursday. Show-cause notices will be sent to 67 other schools that have refused to comply with the government directive to reverse their fee hikes.

Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia plans to hold a meeting with representatives of the schools that have rolled back their hikes in fees, and brainstorm on ideas related to the education sector.

According to officials, the education department had sent notices to 195 private schools over the fee hike on the directions of the chief minister. Around 2 lakh children study in the 128 schools that decided to comply with the order and rolled back their raised fees.

However, a few schools (of the ones that had complied) that TOI spoke to claimed there had been no fee hike at their end in the first place.

Schools: Fee hike linked to rising costs

Claiming that fees had not been raised, one principal said for most schools that are on DDA land with a lease-rider, a fee hike proposal needs to be sent to the directorate of education, complete with audit reports and expense details. This was done for the 2017-18 session too, the principal said.

The directorate of education, after scrutinising the details of the proposals, communicates to the school whether it can increase its fee or not. The school acts accordingly, the principal said.

Several schools said a fee hike is usually proposed keeping in mind the annual increase in the cost of electricity and water.

The principals also clarified that proposals for 2018-19 have not been filed yet as the DoE portal, where details are furnished, has not gone online for this session yet.

Government sources, however, disagreed.

They said that while the schools do submit their proposals to the DoE, they also simultaneously increase their. That is when parents file complaints with the government or the DoE.

Following these complaints, notices are sent to the schools to roll back their fees, which is when they adjust the excess fees over the next few months, the sources added.","128 city schools rolled back fee hike, notices to 67 others: Delhi govt - Times of India","930881788","2018-08-24","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/128-city-schools-rolled-back-fee-hike-notices-to-67-others-delhi-government/articleshow/65522864.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"6339","","MUMBAI: In a move to regulate fee hikes by private schools, a draft amendment to the state's fee regulation Act has proposed that such institutions be allowed to hike fees if they have approval of not less than 76% of the parents or that of the Parent-Teacher Association's executive committee.

Currently, school managements require only PTA'S approval to hike fees, but this is often seen to be a mere formality. The amendment proposes that schools get 76% of the parents to sign off on the plan. Previou-sly, the state had proposed that parents would be able to approach the divisional fee review committee against a hike if they have the backing of 25% of the total parent strength. But the move was perceived to be impractical, given the difficulties involved in mobilizing support among parents in such large numbers. Putting the onus on the school to seek parents' approval may act as a better safeguard against profiteering.

Maharashtra, unlike states like Tamil Nadu, doesn't have a committee which fixes fees for schools. The fee review committees at the district level only hear complaints from schools and parents if the difference in the proposed and acceptable fees is over 15%.

But a former member of a school's PTA executive body said the 76% rule is likely to work against parents. ""The PTA committee is elected by parents and designated with the responsibility to understand the calculations behind a proposed hike. But when we fight fee hikes, we find support in only a handful of parents,"" said the parent.

The 11-page amendment has also proposed that schools be allowed to charge an interest in case of non-payment of fees. While the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, has no mention of charging late fee or fine in case of non-payment, schools were expected to follow the old rule, which allowed them to charge Re 1 per day.

""Schools can collect fees on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis. If a parent wants to pay for six months or annually, they must be allowed to do so and a discount could be given for the same,"" stated the draft. But if a parent does not pay fees in time, the school would be authorized to charge an interest on the late fee. The interest will be decided by the state.

The draft also proposed reducing the number of posts held by parents by one. Parents rued that all amendments favoured school managements. ""Our representation is being reduced, interest has been introduced and fine amount for schools has been reduced,"" said a parent. School education minister Vinod Tawde did not respond to TOI's queries on the draft.","Plan to let pvt schools hike fees if 76% of parents agree - Times of India","926664966","2018-08-17","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/plan-to-let-pvt-schools-hike-fees-if-76-of-parents-agree/articleshow/65431199.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"6342","","India has 3,50,000 private, unaided schools -- 24% of all schools -- where 75 million children, or 38% of all students, study.(Representative Image)

Bringing relief to parents beset by frequent and arbitrary increases in school fees, a government commission is likely to suggest a 10% yearly cap on the fee hike permissible by private, unaided schools, with provisions for penalties in case of violations, two officials familiar with the development said.

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) , a statutory body, is in the process of making a recommendation to that effect to the human resource development (HRD) ministry, the officials said on condition of anonymity.

Although fixing school fees is the domain of state governments, in the absence of a standard fee policy for unaided schools, there has been a growing clamour for central regulations.

India has 3,50,000 private, unaided schools -- 24% of all schools -- where 75 million children, or 38% of all students, study. Such schools do not receive any grant from the government and have to generate their own revenue for sustenance.

Many cities across India have of late seen parents protest arbitrary fee hikes by such schools. In Delhi and Mumbai, for instance, the fee hike in private, unaided schools in last year varied between 10 % and 40 %.

Inundated with complaints from parents, NCPCR, the country's apex child rights body, has drafted regulations to put in place a uniform fee framework for unaided private schools. It will propose setting up a district fee regulatory authority in states to monitor school fee increases.

The draft regulations will also suggest a formula for determining fees, based on a school's location, costs incurred, revenue earned, student strength, and other parameters. ""We will send the draft regulation to HRD ministry shortly for action,"" said a senior NCPCR official.

According to the draft regulations, if a school violates the norms provided in the uniform fee framework, it will be fined 1% of the revenue it generates in the first instance, which will increase to 2 % and 5% for a second and third violation. For any subsequent violation, NCPCR has proposed that the school be put in a ""no admission category"" and barred from admitting new students.

""Instead of closing the school, which jeopardises the schooling of existing students, we have proposed that no fresh admission should be allowed in the school. This will allow the existing students to complete their education,"" said a second NCPCR official involved in drafting the regulations.

The regulation of education-related matters is the domain of the HRD ministry, but NCPCR has stepped in to draft the proposed fee regulations for unaided schools, citing Section 13 of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CPCR) Act, 2005 and Section 32 of Right to Education (RTE) Act, which gives NCPCR the authority to review safeguards under the law to protect of child rights and recommend measures.

Vimla Ramachandran, a professor at the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration, who has been working on elementary education, said that a central regulation to check arbitrary fee hikes will be a welcome move although she has doubts whether one will be passed . ""The private school lobby is very strong and will not allow it to go through,"" she said.

But Avinash Chandra, member of National Independent Schools Alliance, a national federation of private unaided school associations from across India said that if NCPCR has proposed a fee framework they should also look at how much government is spending in their own schools. ""Its not practical. Private schools don't get any aid from government and need to raise their own revenue. We have to spend on ugrading the school infrastructure from time to time. We also have to give good salary package to teachers.""

In the last few years, states such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and more recently Uttar Pradesh have framed laws to regulate fees charged by private, unaided schools. Delhi passed a bill to regulate fee hike in such schools way back in 2015 but it is yet to be become an Act after the Centre objected to some of its provisions.

But lax monitoring has resulted in unaided schools continuing with arbitrary fee hikes. ""The fee structure also varies. A central regulation will go a long way in bringing uniformity in fee structure of such schools and can also result in strict enforcement,"" the first official cited above said.

""Every year, the school increases the fee by 15 %. This year, apart from the fee hike they have taken development charge also but hardly any facilities have been added in the school..,"" said Pramod Lohia, a Delhi parent whose two children study in a Delhi school.","Govt child rights body to recommend 10% cap on fee hike in private schools","904721487","2018-07-13","https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-child-rights-body-to-recommend-10-cap-on-fee-hike-in-private-schools/story-KTD5MObyPLtL7bZ1tt90cM.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"6343","","HYDERABAD: Schools revising their annual fee by more than 10 per cent will now have to appear before the district fee regulatory committee to justify the hike, in case the Telangana government agrees to implement the clarifications submitted by the Prof Tirupathi Rao committee last week.

The Tirupathi Rao Committee, in its report sumbitted to the government in December 2017, had recommended an annual fee hike of 10 per cent for all schools.

""After holding series of discussions, we decided to not allow any increase or decrease in the fee structure. The number of schools that will have to appear before the district fee regulatory committees will be based on the percentage of annual fee hike. Schools that have enhanced it by more than 10 per cent in the last two years will have to appear before the committees. Schools that have increased their fee by less than 10 per cent every year will be excluded from this process,"" Tirupathi Rao, chairman of the committee told TOI.

The Rao committee was constituted by the state government in March last year to examine if private schools were involved in profiteering as the government norms do permit schools to make over five per cent of annual profit. The committee submitted its final report in December, 2017 after a series of extensions spanning 10 months. The government had granted furtheran extention of three months which concluded on June 19, following protests by parents on the recommendation allowing private unaided schools an annual 10 per cent hike. The government sought clarification from the committee over it's rationale behind the recommendation.

While there are 12,000 schools in Hyderabad district alone, committee members claim that ratifying all will be cumbersome. ""Initially, all schools will have to submit their audited accounts for the past two years on the website launched by the school education department. A database will be developed and will be with the government. So far, only 4,500 schools have submitted their audited accounts based on which we will examine the fee issue,"" said Rao.

The committee is also planning to decide a cut-off on percentage of fee hike based on the annual pay revision. However, the modalities into the same are yet to be decided.

Apart from this, the committee has also developed a provision through which parents will be able to raise complaints against schools charging excess fee under various heads. ""Once we have the database on the fee structures, such complaints can be looked into with a click. On par with the Telangana Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee, grievances related to school fee can also be probed,"" said Rao, adding that the recommendations of the committee can only be implemented once the government authorities agree upon it.","Leash on schools: Explain to panel if fee hike is over 10% - Times of India","893604286","2018-06-25","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/leash-on-schools-explain-to-panel-if-fee-hike-is-over-10/articleshow/64730554.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"6344","","KOLKATA: Parents of schoolgoing kids can breathe easy. Most of the city's prominent schools have gone in for a moderate 5% to 12% hike in tuition fees for the coming academic year, with many of them admitting that they ""kept in consideration"" the state government's nudge to restrict hikes to ""manageable levels"".

Several leading schools said they didn't have to incur substantial additional expenditure on beefing-up security on their campuses since measures had been taken in phases easing the financial burden.

Old schools like St Xavier's, Birla High, Don Bosco and Modern High as well as the new-age ones like New Town School, Calcutta Public School and The Heritage have stuck to the unofficial ceiling hinted at by the CM at a meeting with school representatives last year.

CM Mamata Banerjee along with education minister Partha Chatterjee had met principals and administrators along with management members of all city-based private schools at the Town Hall in May last year. A fee regulation committee had been set up by the CM which had representatives from several government and private schools.

The objective of the committee was to draw up a feeband for schools and the maximum fee hike which is acceptable, after taking into account various aspects including facilities and students strength. However, despite three meetings and drafting a proposal, a decision is yet to be arrived at.

Decision on school fee policy soon, says Partha

Anindita Mazumdar, mother of a CBSEschoolstudent in Salt Lake, said, ""The average school fee hike is 10%-15%every year. If theschools consider the government's point of view, it will put lesser burden on parents. Nonetheless, we are waiting for the government to roll out a school fee policy.""

""We will soon take a decision on school fee after discussing with the CM. However, all schools have been requested not to hike fee which is unacceptable to parents and students. A detailed fee-band will soon be set,"" minister Partha Chatterjee said.

The principal of an English-medium school said there was 'little scope' for a steep hike after the CM's diktat. At Birla High School, the hike this year is 10%. ""A steeper hike was not necessary as we have not

had to spend anything additional for security. We already had 350 CCTV cameras,"" said school director Mukta Nain. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, too, has gone for an identical hike.

The Heritage, however, has chosen to move to an annual hike format from this year instead of the three-year fee-revision gap. ""If you wait for three years, sticking to10% turns difficult. So,wehavedecidedto raise the fee by 5%-7% every year which would not be a burden on parents,"" said principal Seema Sapru.

Modern High School for Girls had its last fee revision two years ago. Don Bosco Park Circus, too, has continued with its annual 10% hike taking the monthly fee for 2018-2019 to Rs 3,500. La Martiniere Schools had a 10% fee hike from last year. St Xavier's Collegiate School is among the few big schools whose fee structure remains unchanged from 2017.

"6346","","BENGALURU: Spelling relief for parents of students, the education department has taken steps to regulate fees in private schools across the state. Tuition fee hike will be capped at 15% per year and schools will have to make the fee structure public by December 31.

A notification to this effect was issued by the primary and secondary education department on Friday.

This comes two years after the Karnataka Education Institutions (Classification, Regulation and Prescription of curricula etc,) (Amendment) Rules 2016 were introduced as part of the Siddaramaiah government's efforts to rein in private schools charging exorbitant fees.

The notification makes it mandatory for schools to disclose the following information by December 31 every year: fee structure for the ensuing academic year, audit report of the school's finances in the previous financial year which ended on March 31, details of teaching resources, results of public examinations and a statement showing computation and compliance of fee structure as per the department's rules. The school can't charge more fee than the sum disclosed.

The order has restricted fee increase, saying that tuition fee for the ensuing year to be collected from all students (except RTE quota) shouldn't be more than 15% over and above the amount charged during the current academic year.

The education department also stated that fee calculation should be made considering the normative total expenditure for the ensuing academic year, which should be computed based on the actual salary expenditure incurred on teaching and non-teaching staff, including outsourced staff and operational costs in the previous financial year.

The notification also re-attempts to penalize schools for fee violations. Institutions are supposed to pay a fine of Rs 10 lakh for charging exorbitant fee, a sum which has not been revised for 18 years, but the department hasn't been able to implement the rule.

Not just that. The draft notification also mandates schools not to levy additional amounts (above the fee) on students admitted under the RTE quota. This comes at a time when the RTE task force has been complaining to the department about some private schools charging fee for uniforms and text books.

The circular issued on May 9 says that no action shall be taken against schools.

""The honourable high court, Jodhpur in its interim order has directed the office (department) to not act against schools in cases related to Rajasthan Schools (Regulation of Fee) until cases (related to the fees act) pending in court are disposed off,"" said a circular issued by the education department on May 9. Sources said that almost a dozen cases challenging the legality of the fee Act were pending before the court.

Around 20 schools in Rajsamand and Jodhpur have filed a petition against the Act. The schools contended that they were autonomous bodies and the government can only guide them in fixing the fees.

""Our case is very strong. The Act is a violation of our rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It will not stand in the court,"" said one petitioner.

The education department had served notices to over 7,000 schools over unjust fee hikes. The circular has come as a relief for schools but has left parents and the government jittery. Parents were hoping to get relief from fee hikes of up to 30% made by schools. Government officials are still studying the order which is not clear on whether the schools can charge the hiked fees from students. ""Our legal team is examining the implications of the interim order,"" said a government officer requesting anonymity.

The state government, which had earlier cancelled the no-objection certificate (NOC) of BVB Vidhyashram school over the fee hike issue, is in a dilemma on whether to restore the NOC or to maintain status quo.

The ongoing protests by parents against the exorbitant hike in fee by private schools in Jaipur got a fresh impetus Saturday with the Prime Minister's Office stepping in after taking cognisance of a letter written by an aggrieved parent,

Replying to a letter written by the parent of a student at Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan Vidyashram School highlighting the excessive fee hike, the PMO, in the letter dated April 27, has directed the Rajasthan chief secretary to take action in the matter.

Deepak Jain, a parent, had written to the PMO on April 23, seeking its intervention in the matter. He had also attached the notices issued by the district education officer (DEO) and the director of secondary education department to Vidyashram School for hiking the fee by up to 40 per cent this year.

The letter stated that the school's action was in violation of The Rajasthan Schools (Fee Regulation) Act, 2016 and demanded that the fee hike be revoked.

Last week, the Directorate of Secondary Education had also cancelled the school's No Objection Certificate (NOC). However, hearing a PIL filed by the school, the Rajasthan High Court ordered the government to not take any coercive action against the educational institute.

The school has asked the parents to deposit the hiked fees by May 9.

The PMO has asked the state government to reply to the petitioner and a copy of the same to be uploaded on the portal.

Parents of students at Vidyashram school, meanwhile, carried out a candle light march Saturday evening.

Parents across the city have been protesting against the fee hike by private schools since the start of this academic session in April. While some of the schools had rolled back the fee hike after the protests, others have refused to do so.","Fee hike by Rajasthan private schools: PMO steps in, asks chief secretary to act ","862848710","2018-05-05","https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/fee-hike-by-rajasthan-private-schools-pmo-steps-in-asks-chief-secretary-to-act/story-49bHdZz1bxcsFsr44KauFO.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Cops had to be called in to handle the situation as parents laid siege to the school gates refusing to budge.

""We have started a campaign, Swacch Shiksha Abhiyan, and we are expecting the school to stick to the guidelines issued by the director of Education Department, which has asked them to revoke the fee hike,"" a protesting parent said. He, although, stated that the school has assured a response by April 30, 2018 on the issue of hiked fee structure.

Parents at Sophia school also protested against the fee hike of their wards studying in class XI. ""They have increased the fee by 15 per cent for all classes. However, for students who will be transferred from class X to XI, the fee will now be doubled. I paid Rs 9,640 for class X and now, fee for class XI is Rs18,600, a parent explained comparing the child's progression from class X to class XI.

""We are aware of the effect of revised fee on parents, but funds are needed for development, salaries and other expenses. Increase is only to the tune of 14 to 15 per cent, not more than that.

"6353","","Continuing their agitation against fee hike, parents protested inside the premises of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Vidyashram and St Angela Sophia Senior Secondary School on Saturday.

Parents of students studying at the Pratap Nagar and KM Munshi Marg branches of Vidyashram school gathered at the KM Munshi Marg branch to stage their protest. They alleged that the school authority has been pressurising students to pay the hiked fees.

School authorities called the police to disperse the parents from the premises. When contacted, principal Vidya Sharma refused to comment on the matter.

The school hiked the fee by 25 to 40 percent since the beginning of the new session in April. Parents have voiced their dissent and have filed a writ in the high court challenging the fee hike. The school, on the other hand, also filed a writ challenging the authority of the education department to regulate the school fees.

""The school administration has been harassing students and threatening to take them to the police if their dues are not cleared,"" a parent said on condition of anonymity.

Parents alleged that the school authorities have been singling out students who have not yet paid their fees and threatening to take action against them. The school has extended the last date for the submission of fees to April 30.

Director of secondary education Nathmal Didel has given the school a final chance to present their case in person at the directorate on Monday. In case the school representatives failed to show up, the directorate would have the liberty to cancel the school's No Objection Certificate (NOC), Didel had said.

The final warning was given to the school after they failed to comply with Didel's notice and did not show up on Thursday.

A protest was also staged in front of St Angela Sophia Senior Secondary School by some parents who alleged that the school has hiked the fees by 35 per cent this year.

The school's principal Sister Ramona denied the allegations. ""We have raised the fees by 14 per cent, that too, in compliance with the provisions of the fee regulation Act. The hike is mostly to meet the expense of teachers' salaries,"" Sister Ramona said.

Under the Fee Regulation Act, private schools are supposed to form fee regulation committees with representatives from the school and parents to decide on the fee hike. However, since the beginning of the new session in April, several schools raised the fees by a considerable amount, which led to the protest. The aggrieved parents said that the schools did not form any committee nor consulted the parents and raised the fees arbitrarily.","Parents continue protest against fee hike, say private schools want them to pay up","858821382","2018-04-28","https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/parents-continue-protest-against-fee-hike-say-private-schools-want-them-to-pay-up/story-8VxIUbmqQtZFJs65hVrn0H.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"6354","","GURUGRAM: A pan-India survey conducted by community-oriented social media platform LocalCircles, involving 32,000 participants, has revealed that 57% parents in Haryana have received notices from their children's schools about a fee hike to the tune of around 10%, for the current session, which started roughly a week ago.

Ramesh Rana, president of Haryana Parents' Forum For Education, said, ""All schools raise fees every session by 10-12%. They don't ask parents what the hike should be. They raise school fees at will in the name of rising costs.""

In the second poll, 87% parents said their respective state governments have not taken any action in years to regulate the yearly hikes, while only 13% said otherwise.

Dev Kumar, president of DPSG Parents' Association, said, ""Had the Haryana government acted against the schools, who are always looking to hike the fee, the disparity wouldn't have been so much. There are schools in the city which are run by MPs, MLAs and corporates. This is an education mafia and the state government easily accepts whatever they say.""

When parents were asked about the root cause of these hikes, around 61% said it was due to a lack of regulation by the state, while 14% said it was due to a lack of enforcement by district officers. Many of them also cited lack of funds as the possible reason.

Sameer Nasa, whose kid studies in Blue Bells School, said, ""The state is not willing to regulate school fees because the entire system has become greedy. Schools are increasing the fee citing the Seventh Pay Commission, which is wrong.""

The survey further revealed that 72% parents are of the opinion that fee hike should be based on a model that ties it to the rate of inflation, while 22% said there should be a 10% cap on hikes.

Bhupinder Singh, whose kid study in Narayana e Techno School, Sector 37, said, ""There should be a capon school fee hikes by the authorities. Why should the school alone get to decide this? It shouldn't be raised beyond 3-5% annually.""

On the other hand, schools said the annual hikes are justified. Vaibhav Kapoor, principal of Ajanta Public School, Sector 31, said, ""Every year, we have to increase the teacher's salary. Invariably, we have to do it by increasing the school fee. It's also based on improvements in infrastructure.""

Deepika Sharma, principal of DPSG, Palam Vihar, said, ""The fee hike in our school this year is less than 10%. We do it every year to keep up with maintenance and other costs.

The Fee Regulation Committee of the Ahmedabad zone, while allowing 5 per cent hike in school fees, has indicted private schools of charging ""exorbitant fees"", saying that ""there appears to be a systematic attempt on the part of school management to claim inflated expenses"".

In its April 2 order, the Committee, assigned with the task of determining provisional fees of 32 self-financed schools of nine districts, stated: ""Fees proposed by many schools are exorbitant as compared to the fees charged by them for earlier years. There appears to be a systematic attempt on the part of school management to claim inflated expenses by way of payment of excessive rents for school building, transportation charges and other activity charges.""

The nine districts that fall under the Committee, chaired by retired Gujarat High Court judge K A Puj, are Ahmedabad city, Ahmedabad district, Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Patan, Sabarkantha, Banskantha, Aravalli, Botad and Kutch.

""In many cases, the school management is collecting fees under different heads such as uniform charges, meal charges, activity charges etc. If these are optional and students are free to choose, there may not be any problem. However, when they are compulsory, the element of profit may not be ruled out,"" it added.

The Committee also stated that many schools have failed to submit their complete records. However, it has also allowed the schools to charge higher fee for the year 2018-19 and 2019-20.

""It is made clear that no school is permitted to collect fees for the first quarter of 2018-19 more than the provisional fees determined for the year 2017-18 with 5 per cent rise therein,"" the order read. The annual fees for 2017-18 as decided by the Committee stand at Rs 27,700, Rs 28,600 and Rs 30,800 for pre-primary, lower primary and upper primary classes, respectively.

The Committee has also accepted its limitations in deciding the fee in a short span of time. ""Since the provisional fees for each of these schools are to be determined within a time-bound framework it may not be possible to minutely examine all these details. This exercise will be undertaken by the committee after considering objections, if any, raised by any school against determination of provisional fees by the committee,"" the order further added.

Parents from Gurgaon and Faridabad, who were also part of the group, said that they have asked that all private schools of the state should be audited and profiteering in educational institutes must be brought to a halt.

""Private schools across the state have increased the fees considerably and they are charging extra money, such as for development charges, illegally. We asked the CM to conduct audits and cut out the profit from the school fees,"" said Ramphal Sheoran from Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch.

Parents also asked Khattar to reduce pass percentage of EWS admission from 55% to 33 percent.

The chief minister assured parents of taking up the matter with officials of education department next week, said Sheoran. Earlier in morning, around 50 parents from private schools of Gurgaon and Faridabad also met to discuss the issue of fee hike.

Discussing the way forward on curbing fee hike, parents decided that since Fee and Fund Regulatory Committee (FFRC) has not been auditing the schools as required under Section 158 A of Haryana School Education Act, they will move to court against the unjustified fee hike.

""We'll be approaching local court against the fee hike in private schools since FFRC has not been doing its job. As of now, we'll move to court against two reputed schools of Gurgaon and Faridabad,"" added Sheoran.

While earlier the FFRC conducted yearly audits of selected schools, the process halted after some private schools appealed against its order and questioned its role in the fee regulation.","Parents to Haryana CM: 'Unjustified' fee hike in private schools - Times of India","846328452","2018-04-08","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/parents-to-haryana-cm-unjustified-fee-hike-in-private-schools/articleshow/63672386.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

In order to keep an eye on arbitrary fee hike by private schools, including minority institutions, the Uttar Pradesh government will soon be promulgating an ordinance. Schools with classes 1 to 12 charging over Rs 20,000 per annum as fees will come under its ambit. Deputy Chief Minister Dr Dinesh Sharma told PTI, ""Once the ordinance is notified, the new rules will come into effect from the present academic session (2018-19) prohibiting schools from raising fees arbitrarily. If any school wishes to hike fees, it will have to approach a regulatory committee headed by a divisional commissioner.

Representatives of parents and school management will also be members of the pannel. All the private schools will be covered by the new legislation. However, pre-schools have been kept outside its ambit, Sharma said.

Schools will only be allowed to hike fees by seven to eight per cent after taking permission from the committee, based on the consumer price index and increase in salaries of staff. The draft of the ordinance was approved at a meeting of the state cabinet and seeks to tighten the noose around schools charging hefty fees, the deputy chief minister said.

""We are committed to stop harassment of parents and arbitrary increase in fees by private self-financed schools,"" Sharma said, explaining the salient features of the measure. He added that after the governor's assent, a notification will be issued and it will be implemented immediately in letter and spirit.

""Not only books, but uniforms, shoes and socks are sold by schools or parents are forced to buy these from a certain shop. Our government is committed to check all these wrong practice,"" he said.

Those schools which will break the rules will have to pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh will be levied on schools for their first and second violations, respectively. If a school repeats the mistake, it will be de-recognised. The government has kept a four-point agenda in mind that includes ""happy teacher, tension-free students, copying-free examinations and quality education"", he said.

On the need for such a legislation, Sharma said, ""Education, which was a service earlier, has now become a business. Parents are exploited after their wards get admission."" ""Not only books, but uniforms, shoes and socks are sold by schools or parents are forced to buy these from a certain shop. Our government is committed to check all these wrong practice,"" he said. The first meeting to prepare the draft was held in May last year after which ""we met representatives of CII, FICCI, all-India association of private schools, various associations from Punjab, Delhi, Haryana and other states"", Sharma said. ""We also sought suggestions and even got 134 objections, which were taken note of while preparing the draft,"" he said

""Legal options were also explored and advice of former high court judges was also taken to avoid any legal loopholes.

""Finally a committee headed by the chief secretary okayed it, before it was presented before the cabinet,"" Sharma said, adding that the measure was welcomed by parents all over the state. ""Many a times the meetings ran late into the night, even till 2 AM. All objections were discussed to make it flawless, considering the fact that it was going to be a historic initiative in the interest of parents,"" he said.

Now schools will have to put income generated from commercial activities such as giving its premises for marriage and other functions under the development category, Sharma said. The funds will be spent on increasing teachers salaries and facilities in the school, he said

""Till now, schools used such income in the commercial head and schools did not get any benefit from them (in the form of development). Also, we could not stop them from commercial use so we decided to insert a clause asking them to show such income in school development fund,"" he said.

"6359","","CHENNAI: K Ravi* is a salaried employee of a private firm in the city. For the last few days he has been under immense pressure, not over his work, but over his daughter's education. He had received intimation that the fee was to be hiked substantially for the upcoming year and since then, he has been wondering what he can do to ensure that he can pay his child's school fee. Ravi is one of many parents in the city who are feeling the heat, not because of the summer but rather because private schools in the city have hiked their fees. The surge in school fees ranges from Rs 6,000 to over '30,000 per annum in some cases. Schools are tight-lipped about why the fee is being increased so drastically.

""My daughter's school fee has been increased from '1.1 lakh to about '1.4 lakh,"" said M Ashwin*, a parent of a class 7 student at a private school in South Chennai. ""They have not given us any reason for the increase but if at all someone asks, they say it is because they are building a sports arena. This sports arena has not been completed so long. In the process, the children have not been playing for the last one year. It is ridiculous.""Further, parents said they hesitated to question the fee hike as they thought their children might then be subjected to ill-treatment by the staff and teachers in schools.

While some parents allege that the Goods and Services Tax has led to the surge in fees, schools dismiss this claim and called the hike a 'routine' one. ""The fee hike is done every year in accordance with the guidelines set by the Fee Determination Committee,"" said Principal of a well-known private school on the condition of anonymity. ""The hike has little to do with the Goods and Services Tax. I don't see schools using that as a reason to increase the fees.""

She added that the fee structure is set by the Tamil Nadu Private Schools Fee Determination Committee and hence schools cannot violate what the committee lays down as the rate of increase for the stipulated period. ""Every three years every school has to approach the committee and based on the expenditure of the school and facilities, the committee sets a limit by which the school can hike the fees every year,"" she explained. ""Generally it is not more than 10% but it differs from school to school and board to board.""Last year, the fee committee under Justice TV Masilamani met for the first time in April and had reportedly discussed various issues like the logistics needed for the fee fixation process and enhancing the staff strength for the huge task.

The committee had said it would provide every school with the chance to present their facts and records before fixing the fee. It has the power to determine the fee to be collected by private schools and hear complaints with regards to collection of the fee in excess of the fee determined by it. However, when Express approached the committee to find out if schools were following the diktat issued by them, they said that there were schools which were flouting the rules. ""There are some schools that are charging amounts that are above the prescribed limit,"" said an official of the committee on the condition of anonymity.

""There are schools which are supposed to charge '9,000 as the fees but they charge '18,000 in the name of some trust or other facilities. They do this without the knowledge of the committee and if parents feel that the school is charging an exorbitant fee that is not justified or in line with the guidelines of the committee, they can approach the committee and complain. The committee will definitely look into it and take action.""

The official added that schools should not force parents to pay the entire amount in one go. He said it is mandatory for the fee to be split over three terms and for parents to be given the option of paying it before every term. He did, however, say that if a parent voluntarily wants to pay the fee at one time, that is permissible. Those from lesser privileged backgrounds are feeling the pinch more than anyone else. Many of them put a lot on the line just to ensure their children can go to a reputed private school and receive good education. The hope is that their children will not have to lead the lives that they did. However, with such a spike in fees, it makes it very hard for parents to keep their children in such schools.

""I am getting very worried now,"" said Rahul Kumar*, who works as a driver for a family and is sending his son to a private school in the suburbs for education. ""The school has not intimated us about a hike as yet but I heard from many people that the fee is being hiked steeply this year; so I am very uneasy. I wanted my son to get a good education; but, if it continues like this, I will have to send him back to my village to study because the city schools are too expensive.""For parents whose children are graduating from Montessori school to LKG too, the fee figure is a looming nightmare.

"6360","","Lucknow: The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh took an important decision to regulate the fee hike in private schools of the state. The cabinet on Tuesday gave an in-principle approval to the UP Self-Financed Schools (Fixation of Fee) Ordinance 2018, failing to which the licence of the school will be revoked.

Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma said, ""The fee process will be more transparent now with only four type of fees like booklet fee, entrance fee, examination fee and joint annual fee. Private schools will have to charge admission fees only once per student. If a school fails to comply with the ordinance more than twice, its licence may also be revoked.""

Sharma said the fee structure of private schools will be divided into two categories. ""The first is what the school can charge from students, including admission fees, exam fees, registration fees and annual fees. For all remaining heads, students will pay only for those services which they avail. It will be mandatory for schools to give receipt of all types of fees,"" he added.

Regarding changing school dresses from time to time, the Deputy CM said the government has no desire to interfere in their day-to-day functioning.

""We are only reacting to complaints by parents. Once the ordinance comes into force, the uniforms won't be changed before five years. The schools can also not force parents or students to purchase the uniform from a certain dealer.""

As per the ordinance, private schools who are charging fees of over Rs 20,000 per student per year won't be able to increase the fees by more than 7-8% annually. The base year for calculation of increase in fee is 2015-16 and if parents have paid more than what is required, the extra amount will be refunded. Also, the school cannot take the entire fee for one year as annual fee; they will have to take it quarterly or half-yearly.

Most importantly, as per the ordinance, a committee will be formed under all divisional commissioners, which will comprise a chartered accountant, a PWD engineer and one representative of a school's parents association. The committee will be empowered to look into any kind of dispute related to the school.","Yogi Govt Brings Ordinance to Regulate Fee Hike in UP Private Schools","843723903","2018-04-04","https://www.news18.com/news/politics/yogi-adityanath-govt-brings-ordinance-to-regulate-fee-hike-in-up-private-schools-1707657.html","News18",FALSE
"6361","","JAIPUR: Taking advantage of the ambiguity in the Rajasthan Private School Fees Act, 2017, private schools in the city have raised the annual fee by up to 27%.

The astronomical rise in fees has left parents in a financial soup. But, what is shocking is, unbeknown to parents, the new fee has been decided in 'consultation' with them.

As per the Act, the fee is decided in every school by a 10-member school fee committee which includes five parents, three teachers and two representatives from the school administration.

The committee proposes the hike after considering the expenses, facilities, teachers' qualification, etc. Sources said that the state expected to restrict the yearly rise between 5% and 8%.

But most of the schools have raised the fees above the maximum, with BVB Vidhyashram increasing it by a whopping 27%.

The annual fees for classes I to 5 jumped from Rs 68,000 in 2017-18 to Rs 84,000 in 2018-19. TOI repeatedly called up the school to speak to the principal but received no response.

Parents said that they feel cheated about the hike approved by the school-level fee committee for the new academic session.

The Act says that every school has to form a Parent -Teacher Association (PTA), with five if its members picked through lottery for the fee committee.

The names of members in the committee have to be displayed on the notice board within a period 15 days from the formation of the committee.

But when TOI spoke to parents of students studying in various schools, they expressed ignorance about the formation of any such committee.

Anubha Goyal, a mother of two children studying in classes 4 and 9 at BVB Vidhyashram, was not aware about the role of parents in deciding the fees. ""The hike is not justifiable. The facilities they provide to our children are very minimal. The furniture is broken and tears the uniform. Even big classrooms have only two fans which make it unbearable for our children. I have complained many times to the authority, but no action has been taken,"" she said.

According to the Act, the PTA has to meet before August 15 and the school-level fee committee has to meet once every three months. None of the parents that TOI contacted have been invited for the general meeting or informed about the fee committee.

What is more surprising is that many schools have not formed the committee due to objections while others due to ignorance. Sarita Katiyar, principal of Ryan International School, Mansarovar, said the school has not formed the fee committee. ""I am not aware of constituting any committee for fee fixing,"" said Katiyar. TOI repeatedly called Lata Rawat, the principal of Cambridge Court High School, to enquire about fee hike but received no response.

With tension mounting between parents and schools over the issue, sparks are set to fly at the start of the next academic session.","Parents in the dark as Jaipur schools hike fees - Times of India","841976361","2018-04-01","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/parents-in-the-dark-as-city-schools-hike-fees/articleshow/63561978.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has approved a cap of up to 8 per cent fee hike in private schools of Chandigarh, according to the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institution Bill, 2016, with some modifications.

What happens next?

In its order, the High Court has stated that the draft of the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institution Bill, 2016, has been sent for publication at the government press for issuing the notification. Education Secretary B L Sharma said the rules will be in effect on the date the notification is published, which may happen in a week or so. For any act, the implementation starts from the day of publication of the notification. In this case, the UT education department will circulate an advisory on the rules to be implemented at all the private schools once the notification is out. The next hearing is on April 19 where HC will listen to the status report on the matter.

Will the rules be implemented at private schools from the 2018-19 session?

With the new session about to begin in the first week of April, the fee hike rules will not apply to private schools this session as parents have already paid the fees. Sharma said any transaction made before the notification will not be covered by the new rules. ""It is a breather for private schools this session as they have vehemently opposed the implementation of the Punjab rules. But, they will have to comply from the session 2019-20,"" he added. In February, when the proposal was in its final stage of approval with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the education department planned to extend the February 12 deadline for fee submission in schools. However, this did not materialise due to a delay in approval. This year, schools have hiked the fee between 8 per cent and 12 per cent.

Why has this remained a contentious issue between parents and schools? Why did the education department decide to mirror the Punjab rules?

In the absence of a proper policy, schools hike the fee by 10-12 per cent each year. In 2017, after a number of parents moved court on the fee hike by private schools, the UT Administration told the High Court that it has proposed to extend the Punjab rules to Chandigarh. A draft was prepared by the education department last year and they were awaiting a nod from the Centre for its implementation.

A petitioner, Ritesh Pandey, approached the court through a PIL in February 2017, seeking directions on the arbitrary fee hike of private schools. Pandey submitted that the schools have hiked the fee by 10 per cent, by clubbing the development and tuition fees. Schools, on the other hand, say there is a high possibility that the implementation will face a lot of litigation from the schools. According to them, a ruling by the Supreme Court states that schools can increase the fee up to 10 per cent. Another SC ruling also says that there can be no parity between the fee structure of schools as each offers a different educational experience.

Under the Societies Registration Act, charitable organisations could seek tax concession if there was a surplus expenditure of up to 10 per cent. Beyond that, it became a commercial activity and then they could be brought under the tax net. Hence, the ruling by the Supreme Court.

What do the Punjab fee regulation rules state and what are the modifications proposed by UT?

Besides providing for the constitution of a regulatory body, the rules contain provisions on imposing penalty on the educational institutions resorting to unjustified hike of the annual fee.

The UT, in its draft policy, proposed to double the penalty in case a school violates the rules. The MHA asked UT to amend the policy for the penalty to be stricter.

This fine can go up to Rs 2 lakh, according to the new rules. Schools will have to justify the fee hike under the Act and submit to audit by the education department to justify their hike.

"6363","","NOIDA: Nearly 200 parents protested against the three-fold fee hike in the four government inter colleges of Gautam Budh Nagar outside the Panchsheel Balak Inter College on Tuesday. They demanded that the schools be taken over by the state government under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay model school scheme under which 166 new schools have been started by the UP government.

Built in 2010, schools were free for first two years and fees started being charged in 2012. However, in 2018 the schools revealed the new structure to new and old students.

While two-month fee for a class VI child in SC/ST category till 2017 was Rs 5,775 including three fee sections -- pupil fee, tution fee and transport charges, the fee has been increased to Rs 16,950 in 2018- -- almost three times the previous year. The new sections include admission fee, caution money (refundable), maintenance charge, co-curricular activity, examination and e-learning and lab fee.

They alleged a minor percentage was reduced from the fees after a meeting with Meerut mandal commissioner Prabhat Kumar, who is also the chairman of Noida-Greater Noida education society, which manages four schools funded by authorities.

""We met the commissioner 10 days ago and he promised some respite but to our shock, fee was reduced by between Rs 500-1,000,"" a parent said.

Prabhat Kumarsaid they will look into the demands. ""The fee has not been hiked for a long time.

"6364","","KOLKATA: The state's proposed restrictions on fee hike were greeted with scepticism by city schools, many of whom felt it could stunt their growth and undermine their autonomy.

Senior management staff of a school run by the Church of North India (CNI) , for instance, feared that they might find it difficult to maintain the old school building which has a heritage status. ""We spend crores on upkeep. We also provide free education to financially weak students. How can we run a school if we decide to increase only 10% development fee every year?"" he asked.

A senior school principal pointed out that salary of staff, yearly increment and the enhanced government DA were an addition to its expenses, apart from the house rent allowance for teachers. ""How can a school, which pays for all of this from the students' fee, afford a mere 10% development fee hike every year. We have several school buildings which need upkeep. It is not possible to implement such decisions without uniform consent from schools,"" he said.

Some schools with minority status protested the government's possible decision to ""impose"" the fee cap. Sources said they are worried of the state trying to breach their autonomous status as they are only governed by the set of rules framed by the church and do not even come under the RTE Act, 2009.

A school which had initially sent a representative to the self-regulation commission said they were not keen to implement the decision till the Church takes a call.

Another school principal, however, welcomed the initiative. . But he felt that the new structure should not be imposed. ""Let the state create a neutral accreditation body which can determine fee. If schools satisfy norms then they should be graded and allowed to charge fee as per the grade. A general slab can't be fixed for schools,"" he said.","Kolkata schools fear fee-hike cap could undercut autonomy - Times of India","837452470","2018-03-24","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/kolkata-schools-fear-fee-hike-cap-could-undercut-autonomy/articleshow/63437846.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"6365","","Maharashtra government has cracked the whip on the private schools on the contentious issue of fee hike. The government will soon promulgate an ordinance whereby 25 per cent parents and not just the members of the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) body can approach the statutory fee revision panel against the hike. The government proposes to increase the involvement of parents instead of just restricting it to the PTA body against the fee hike.

The government will launch this new initiative from ensuing academic year.

Besides, the government proposes to increase the number of parents' representation on PTA, an executive body whose approval is must for a fee increase. Henceforth, more parents can be appointed on PTA through lottery system as the government had received several complaints that even parents' representatives were selected in such a way that they would be in favour of the management.

In order to give much needed relief to parents, the government proposes to give them freedom to purchase school material from the shops of their choice, and not those assigned by the school. The state education minister, Vinod Tawde, while replying to a calling attention motion, announced these decisions in the state Assembly on Tuesday moved by BJP legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar and others.

Officer from the state education department said political parties and various organisations had said that even though the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of School) Fee Act, 2011 prohibits schools from hiking fees more than once in two years, it does not put any cap on the hike. Parents want the act to define upper limits for the hikes. Further, they objected to the schools collecting hefty sums for uniforms, stationery, security deposit and other extra-curricular activities.

However, government's proposed initiatives has evoked a mixed reactions from parents associations.

""With these guidelines, cases where there would be few parents opposing the hike in a large strength of students will not be entertained. Even a single parent should have a right to lodge a complaint,"" said Anubha Sahai, President of the India Parents Association.

""There is no implementation of the existing laws against fee hikes and one cannot thus expect anything from the government,"" said Suchita Ghag, a parent from Mumbai adding that the provisions were an eyewash.

"6366","","The state government has issued notification to implement Madhya Pradesh Private School Bill -2017 in order to prevent private schools from unanticipated fee increase.

This bill has come into effect from February 22. According to the main provision of the bill, the school management can increase fee up to 10 percent limit over the fee fixed for the previous year.

If school management proposes to raise school fee between 10 to 15 percent as compared to the previous year, then it is essential for the school management to obtain approval from the district committee formed under the chairmanship of district collector.

Similarly, if school proposes increase of over 15 percent in the fee, then approval is required from the state committee formed under the chairmanship of Commissioner Public Instructions.

District committees formed in connection with the fee and related issues can conduct an enquiry in the cases of violation of fee related rules and complaints. If committee finds that the fee, more than the prescribed rule is being charged by the school management then the committee can issue order to the school to refund it to the parents.

Along with this, district committee has been empowered to impose penalty up to Rs. 2 lakh. Moreover, in case of non-compliance of first order, second order for refund can be issued by the committee and a penalty of up to Rs. 4 lakh can be imposed.

After the non compliance of the second order, the committee can impose a penalty up to Rs. 6 lakh and can send recommendation to the competent authority for suspension and cancelation of recognition of the private school.

This decision of the schools education department will control the trend to collect money under various heads in the name of fee and unanticipated fee increase by the private schools.","Bill to check fee hike in private schools comes into effect","821894000","2018-02-28","http://www.centralchronicle.com/bill-to-check-fee-hike-in-private-schools-comes-into-effect.html","Central Chronicle",FALSE

The state government which is a respondent in the case had to hear tough words from the single bench of Justice Manoj Misra on October 5 when the court had directed it to file a counter report on February 5.

The government has now sought more time from the court for compliance of the high court order. However, the court noted on Thursday that no counter report has been filed by the state on subsequent hearings on February 5 and February 22.

The petition has been filed against different private schools of the state for indulging in ""arbitrary fee hike"" including those in Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad and Kanpur.

These were clubbed with the writ petition 46207 filed by Shailendra Kumar Singh of Ghaziabad and others against 12 respondents in 2017.

Weeks after the HC quashing the government order, parents flay that the government is a mute spectator to their misery.

Though disappointed, they are preparing to challenge the court stay legally in the coming days. Hyderabad School Parents Association (HSPA), that has been fighting the indiscriminate hike in fees by schools, claims it had anticipated the stay. ""We knew the school managements would try to stay the government order and hence wanted the government to file a caveat in the court. However, the government's unwillingness resulted in the stay,"" say association members. Not being a party in the case, the HSPA could not file a caveat on its own.

Neither was a caveat filed nor were we informed for reasons best known to the government,"" said Seema Agarwal of HSPA.

""Had the government impressed upon the court that the issue has been pending since 2009, and that between 2009 and 2018 school fees have increased by a massive 500 per cent, the court would not have, perhaps, passed the interim order,"" fume parents. ""The government also has at its disposal all the proofs of extreme profiteering by schools, including those submitted by HSPA. However, these too it seems, have not been brought to the notice of HC,"" alleged Seema.

A statement issued by HSPA has questioned the government's intention in the matter. ""The actions or the lack of it seem to suggest that the government finds the schools more powerful than itself. That is why it is acquiescing meekly before the schools allowing them to ride roughshod over all its orders,"" it read.

Meanwhile, most parents feel the respite they got from the freezing of fee hike is now over and they now have to revise their budgets to accommodate additional expenditure. ""It is only a matter of days when the schools will send circulars detailing their new and hiked fee structure. Several schools had already sent the new fee structure but had to grudgingly withdraw it due to the government directive,"" said Rachana Sharma, a parent.

What next?

"6376","","HYDERABAD: In a major relief to parents, the school education department has made it clear that no school in the state will be allowed to jack up fees for the ensuing academic year 2018-19. The schools have been directed to ""maintain status quo"" and continue with the fees charged for the 2017-18 academic year till the government takes a decision on implementation of the recommendations of the Prof Tirupati Rao committee report. In a circular issued on Thursday, the school education department said that all private, recognised, un-aided and aided schools in the state, whether they follow CBSE/ICSE/IB/ Cambridge or state syllabus, have ""to maintain status quo on the fee until further orders i.e., whatever fee is already in existence for the academic year 2017-18 will be continued for this academic year.''

It may be noted that just days after the the committee submitted its report, the admission process in all schools began and will go on till January 12. In the absence of any direction from the government on fees, schools have issued circulars detailing an enhanced fee structure, much to the chagrin of parents.

The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) on Wednesday conveyed its concerns about fee structure to special chief secretary Ranjeev R Acharya and minister KT Rama Rao. ""We pointed out that since the report questioned only the fee hike percentage and not the base fee, a school charging ' 50,000 as fees in 2017-18 could increase it by 100 per cent, making it '1 lakh in 2018-19 and then also expect a minimum hike of 10 pc over and above that every year as per Prof Rao's recommendations,"" said Ashish Naredi, a member of HSPA.

Though happy with the government's intervention, parents are aware that it is just an interim relief. ""The bigger task for the government would be to come out with an equally stringent order. The final order, in fact, would be the most crucial as it would deal with annual hike,"" said Seema Agarwal, another member.","No hike in fees until further orders, govt tells private schools","788402499","2018-01-05","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2018/jan/05/no-hike-in-fees-until-further-orders-govt-tells-private-schools-1744979.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"6377","","Teens go through a lot of transformation in their lives, making them more prone to being angry, depressed and anxious. If not given enough attention this can have dire consequences like death too.

14-year-old Dev Tadvi, was hacked to death in a bathroom at Bharti School in Vadodara's Wadi area. On Friday, Dev became an unfortunate victim to the design of the 16-year-old accused who wanted to disgrace the school. The accused wanted to disgrace his school for being reprimanded by a teacher. The accused wanted to see if the school closed when he killed Tadvi, who he met a couple of minutes before, in the bathroom of Bharti School. The accused revealed this to police after he was held from Valsad on Friday night.

The boy, who was at his aunt's house in Valsad, told police he was agitated as a teacher had scolded him for not doing his homework two days before he committed the crime.

Officials say that he felt insulted and wanted to get the school closed. He then planned to kill someone in the school so it would be forced to shut down. According to the police, the boy's planning was almost foolproof and that if two schoolboys hadn't been in the washroom and seen him commit the crime, the killer would not have been identified. The boy even removed his shirt before stabbing Tadvi so it wouldn't get stained.

After stabbing Tadvi, the accused fled to his aunt's house and changed his clothes. When his father came to know of the incident, he boarded a bus with his son and reached Valsad.

However, by the time they reached Valsad, the two boys who were witness to the crime, revealed the killers identity. The accused were nabbed once they reached Valsad with the help of local police there. ""Tadvi collapsed after the first stab, but the perpetrator repeatedly stabbed Tadvi in his neck,"" said ACP S G Patil.","Gurugram Rerun In Gujarat?

"6378","","In a grim reminder of the murder of a seven-year-old student in Gurugram last year, a Class 9 student was found dead with multiple stab wounds in the washroom of a school in Gujarat's Vadodara on Friday. The police have arrested a Class 10 student under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act in connection with the killing, an official said on Saturday.

The 14-year-old boy was found dead with ten stab wounds on his body on Friday, Deputy Police Commissioner RS Bhagora said.

The 17-year-old accused, a student of the same school located in the city's Baranpora area, was caught in Valsad town in South Gujarat, Vadodara Police Commissioner Manoj Sashidhar told PTI. He became a suspect in the case after officials spotted him on CCTV camera footage entering the washroom along with the victim, the police said.

The Class 10 student, according to the Hindustan Times, has confessed to the murder and told the police that he had planned it to force the school to close as revenge for teachers scolding him. Sashidhar was quoted as saying in the report that the accused had no animosity towards the victim but had displayed behavioural problems in the past and was scolded by his teachers.

Jagruti Pandya, chairperson of the Gujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said the mental condition of the accused will be examined.

Earlier, Bhagora had said that the murder could have been the result of a fight between the two children.

The victim had joined the school only a week before he was killed and had been staying with his maternal uncle. His parents live in Gujarat's Anand town, the police said.

The Vadodara case is eerily similar to the murder of a seven-year-old student in Gurugram's Ryan International School in September last year. The Class 2 student was found in a pool of blood, with his throat slit, in the school's washroom on 8 September. An inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation had found that a Class 11 student had killed the child to have the school shut down and a parent-teacher meeting and exam postponed.
