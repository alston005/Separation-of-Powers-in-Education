The Manipur government on Thursday suspended three staffs of Imphal's Sajiwa Central Jail, including the head warden, for allegedly being involved in cuffing a Manipur University (MU) teacher while producing him for a medical check-up.

The suspension of the jail staffs comes two days after the Manipur Human Rights Commission (MHRC) lodged a suo motto case against the jail authorities and Manipur police terming the incident a serious violation of human rights of the undertrial prisoners.

An order issued by the P Doungel, ADGP Jail, said the three jail staffs have been placed under suspension with immediate effect for disciplinary proceedings are contemplated against them.

The ADGP also barred the suspended staffs from leaving their headquarters without prior information to the superintendent of the jail.

Prof. S Dorendrajit, Department of Physics, was one of the six teachers lodged in the Sajiwa Central Jail after being arrested during a raid in MU campus on September 20 midnight. On September 11, he was brought to JNIMS hospital for a medical examination with his hands cuffed by the jail staff.

The incident invited criticism against the Manipur Government. Reacting to the incident, Chief Minister N Biren Singh assured stringent action against those involved.

The arrested students and teachers of the varsity, including Prof. S. Dorendrajit, were later released on Tuesday after signing a MoU between the agitators and Manipur Government.

Soon after his release, Dorendrajit termed the episode distasteful and de-humanising. ""I find the treatment given to me by the jail authority not dignified for a teacher,"" he added."

A teacher who claimed that Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump's senior policy adviser and an immigration hardliner, ate glue as a kid has reportedly been suspended from her job.

Teacher Nikki Fiske told The Hollywood Reporter this week that, as a child, Miller would ""pour the glue on his arm, let it dry, peel it off, and then eat it. He was a strange dude.""

""I remember being concerned about him - not academically. He was OK with that, though I could never read his handwriting. But he had such strange personal habits. He was a loner and isolated and off by himself all the time,"" she said.

She said that she had a lot of ""concerns"" about Miller, so the school's principal ""took some white-out and blanked out all my comments.""

""Of course, Stephen wasn't political then - it wasn't until later that he started to make waves,"" Fiske wrote.

Now, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District has placed her on ""home assignment"" while it decides what to do, if anything, about Fiske's comments, the Los Angeles Times reported.

A school district spokesperson told the Times that they were concerned about ""her release of student information.""

Miller has been a rising star on the far right for years, often making headlines because of his polarizing demeanor and statements.

Miller is reportedly sometimes too extreme even for President Trump. His uncle criticized him in an op-ed for Politico in August, who wrote that Millier's policies today would have made his families journey from Eastern Europe to a series of successful family businesses in the US impossible."

The teacher in charge of a North Delhi Municipal Corporation primary boys school in Wazirabad has been

suspended for segregating Hindu and Muslim students into different sections.

The Indian Express reported on Wednesday that the section-wise break-up of students showed segregation on religious lines. The teacher, C B Singh Sehrawat, had denied deliberate segregation, but said it ""was a management decision to try and do the best we can to see that there is peace, discipline and a good learning environment in the school"".

He undertook this action without any kind of direction or guidance from any official from the education department. We received no information or complaint regarding this earlier. We were shocked when we heard about this,"" said a senior official of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation's education department.

According to a PTI report, the Union HRD Ministry has asked for a report. ""We haven't received any complaint yet but have read about it in media reports. I have asked for a report,"" HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar was quoted as saying.

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights has sent a notice to the head of the school and the director (education), North Delhi Municipal Corporation, asking what procedure was followed in assigning sections to students. It has directed the immediate dissolution of the current sections and asked the authorities to ""ensure homogenous distribution of students"" within two days of receipt of the notice.

In a statement, Mayor, North Delhi, Adesh Gupta said: ""Social divide on the basis of caste, community or religion will not be tolerated in schools of North Delhi Municipal Municipal Corporation... If any such divide is found to be in practice, it will be rectified immediately and strict action will be taken against those found guilty."" He confirmed that the teacher in-charge has been suspended and ""major penalty proceedings"" have been initiated against him.

""It is shocking that the seeds of hatred are being sown among children of such a tender age... When a child is sent to school, he is not told whether he is Hindu or Muslim, he is only sent to be educated and absorbs knowledge by sitting in a classroom with students from all religions... Which political leader or municipal officer's directions are behind this action needs to be found out through a high-level investigation and strict action needs to be taken,"" said Mukesh Goel, Leader of Opposition, North Delhi Municipal Corporation.

It was like a durbar scene from the middle ages. A woman, advanced in years, pleads with the all-powerful ruler sitting on a raised platform meters away to help her. The ruler incensed that she has the temerity to raise her voice in front of him decrees: ""Suspend her! Take her into custody, now!""

The woman was Uttara Bahuguna, a 57-year-old primary school teacher. The all-powerful ruler was TS Rawat, the chief minister of Uttarakhand. The incident took place on June 28, during a public hearing that the chief minister was presiding over. The state police, following Rawat's decree, arrested Bahuguna on charges of ""disrupting an important gathering"". She was later released on bail.

Bahuguna, who has worked as a teacher for 25 years, has been posted at a school in a remote part of the hill state for most of her career. Having lost her husband three years ago, and with just a few years left to retire, she had asked to be posted to the state capital Dehradun, where her son lives.

When Bahuguna raised her transfer request, Rawat asked her if she had not read the rules before she signed up for the job. Bahuguna retorted that she had not signed up for a life of exile. It was this sharp statement that riled Rawat whose wife, Sunita Rawat, also a government primary school teacher, has been posted at one school in Dehradun, the state capital, for the past 22 years.

Using the Uttarakhand government's own classification, Sunita Rawat has had a sugam or desirable posting for 22 years and Bahuguna has had a durgam or undesirable posting for 17 years of the 25 years she has been a teacher. Under the terms of the state's transfer rules, Sunita Rawat's is a fit case for transfer to a durgam location and Bahuguna's to a sugam one.

Political interference

Undesirable postings are usually to those parts of the country that are in most need of attention. Their inaccessibility is often the major reason for their underdevelopment, and their underdevelopment is the major reason most people who choose to work in government do not want to work there. This is as true for teachers - some of who turn down promotions for fear of an undesirable posting - as it is for doctors and administrators.

Uttarakhand, for example, offered medical students a fee discount if they signed a bond that required them to work in the state's hilly districts for at least two years after they graduated. In 2014, of 331 doctors appointed on this basis and posted to rural health centres, only 66 turned up for work. That the government had to resort to a bond to get doctors to work in the state's hilly districts is a reflection of the general disinclination of government doctors to accept postings to these areas.

Governments in India have not found a workable solution to ensure that the remote, underdeveloped, undesirable corners of India are properly served.

Political interference is at the root of the problem. State governments have rules, laws and now computer-aided systems to try and make transfers and postings transparent. But all their systems are all too easily subverted by politicians for whom postings and transfers are a source of enormous power. Those who are politically well-connected can expect to receive a transfer or posting request as a favour. The rest may have to pay. A civil servant, who has worked in a state education department said: ""it is informally called the transfer industry...MLAs and education ministers make money on teacher transfers"". Teachers say, so do some bureaucrats.

Students suffer

Uttara Bahuguna's case has focused attention on the insouciance of politicians who live in glass houses and on the heartlessness with which the system treats those who are not active Union members and not politically well connected.

But it also highlights what this system means for the communities that are supposed to be served. In the last 17 years, Bahuguna has been on leave for long periods - longer than a year at a time. She said this was because of her late husband's poor health. At present, she has been on leave since August. This means that the school she is posted at, which likely has only a total of two or three teachers, has been short of a teacher, an experienced one at that.

This system works neither for Bahuguna, nor for her young students."

The back-and-forth grew heated as Ms Bahuguna insisted that the CM give her justice.

""I never signed up for exile all my life,"" Ms Bahuguna said. Annoyed, the CM asked her to ""mind her language"" and then shouted, ""Suspend karo ise abhi (Suspend her immediately). Arrest her.""

In a video clip, the teacher is seen screaming at the CM and shouting ""thief, cheats"" as she is led out of the meeting.

Uttara Bahuguna was arrested on charges of ""disrupting an important gathering"". She was let off in the evening.

After the incident, Rawat said that request for transfers must not be brought to a platform meant for hearing public grievances. ""All transfers of government employees will be done under the state's Transfer Act,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Rajya Prathamik Shikshak Sangh Secretary General Digvijay Singh Chauhan said he would speak to the authorities and request them not to take any harsh action against her.

When the students ask her to elaborate on what needs to be done, she says, ""In order to finish some things successfully they are expecting college students. Till now, I have not gone down to that level. I can only say so much. I believe you will understand what they expect. If you accept this scheme, MKU will be your backbone.""

Meanwhile, secretary of the college R Ramasamy held a press conference on Sunday explaining the action taken by the college. He said the faculty member had gone to attend a refresher course in MKU on March 9.

As soon as the complaint was received, she was asked to report back to the college. As soon as she returned on March 21, the suspension order was handed over to her.

A committee formed by the college is conducting a probe and further action would be taken based on its outcome.

When contacted, Virudhunagar superintendent of police M Rajarajan said they have not received any complaint so far.

A Class 7 student has been suspended after he allegedly threatened a teacher and her daughter with rape, a prominent private school in Gurgaon said in a statement on Tuesday.

In the same school, a Class 8 student allegedly asked a teacher out for a candlelight dinner and sex. It was not known if any action had been taken against this student.

Both the incidents took place last week and the school put out a statement about the suspension on Tuesday evening without saying when the decision was taken.

""A thorough investigation was carried out and stern action was taken, including suspension along with mandated counselling. The school has a zero-tolerance policy towards such acts,"" the statement said.

The incident involved a lower middle school student ""allegedly indulging in an offensive and highly objectionable cyber prank involving a teacher"", it added.

Gurgaon child welfare committee chairperson Shakuntla Dhull said they would send a notice to the school and investigate the incident.

""We have not received any information regarding this case if we receive we will take cognisance. Once the matter is reported to us we will conduct counselling sessions and try to understand the psychology of the child,"" Dhull said.

Experts said a monitoring of the social media activities and internet behaviour of students, in school as well as at homes, could curb such tendencies.

They also blamed unsupervised access to the internet was one of the reasons for rise in such incidents of abuse.

The two incidents come a few weeks after the Gurgaon juvenile justice board ruled that a 16-year-old boy be tried as an adult for allegedly murdering a junior student in the school.

The murder, which shook the country, raised questions about safety of children and also reflected the worrying trend of underage children taking to crime."

KV-1 principal and staff faced commotion from parents on January 29 on school premises after girls of Class IX and XI had complained against the Biology teacher Snehlata Shankhwar for making objectionable remarks on the girls who were outgoing in nature, who wore lipstick and revealing clothes.

The girls had secretly recorded several audios as proof and shared them with their parents. The girls told parents that they had sent a written complaint to the principal but no action was taken while they were continuously subjected to embarrassment and humiliation before other boys in the classroom.

Talking to TOI, Bhagwandas Ahire, principal KV-1 said, ""Based on written complaint submitted by parents, I formed an inquiry committee and personally monitored it. Within 24 hours of complaint, the committee had submitted report based on preliminary investigation, to deputy commissioner of KV who issued suspension of the teacher.""

He added that suspension was done on Wednesday evening with immediate effect and the teacher has been asked for temporary deputation at KV-2 till further orders. A high-level inquiry would now be conducted against teacher by the higher authorities of KV in Delhi.

The teacher was suspended after the claims made by parents and girls were found to be true in the initial probe.

Clarifying on not taking action upon complaint made by the students, the principal said that he had received an anonymous letter which could have been a mischief. Also, two days after the letter was received was holiday.

During the lectures, the teacher used to warn girls against wearing jeans and lipstick, saying, ""Girls expose their body only when they don't have beautiful faces. Girls have become so shameless, why did Nirbhaya go out so late at night with a boy who wasn't her husband? It's difficult to understand why an issue was made of this.

""Based on a written complaint by the parents, I formed an inquiry committee and personally monitored it. Within 24 hours of the complaint, the panel submitted its preliminary investigation report to the KV deputy commissioner, who issued suspension orders,"" Ahire said.

The teacher has been sent on temporary deputation to KV-2 till further orders. A high level inquiry will now be conducted against her by senior KV officials in Delhi, Ahire said.

Shankhwar had allegedly converted her class into cringe worthy sermon sessions, telling students that 'outgoing' girls are asking for rape. In an audio clip secretly recorded by one of the students, the teacher is heard 'warning' girls against wearing jeans and lipstick as it attracts Nirbhaya-like ordeal.

She also allegedly told students that girls ""expose their body only when they don't have a beautiful face"".

Shankhwar's comments on Nirbhaya and girls' dress sense had triggered nationwide outrage. On January 29, parents had marched to the school and demanded action against her. When the news got out, she tried to defend her statement.

""What happened with Nirbhaya was wrong but she could have saved herself, if she had not gone out late,"" she told media persons."
