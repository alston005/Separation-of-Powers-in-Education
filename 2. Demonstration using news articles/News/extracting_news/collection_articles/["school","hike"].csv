All The Elements Of A Volatile Cauldron Are In Place","swarajyamag.com",FALSE,"The US economy appears to be in a vulnerable position. What might follow later in 2019 would make the Great Depression pale in comparison.

The year 1929 was the beginning of what is now known as the Great Depression -- a period of prolonged economic stagnation worldwide that was triggered by the American stock market crash of October 1928. Between 1929 and 1933, the global gross domestic product (GDP) had plunged by 15 per cent and the economic stagnation continued till 1940 -- or until 1946 -- depending on how we choose to view GDP itself. Bulk of the addition to the GDP post 1940 was wartime goods production, which neither had a market pricing nor any consumer utility. Most objective measurements showed a declining standard of living until 1946.

As I see it, we are set for a repeat of the Great Depression -- worse in many ways as I will explain -- in the years ahead. Whether it starts in 2019 or a bit later is something that is hard to predict, but all the ingredients of a volatile cauldron are already in place. An extraordinarily lax monetary policy for more than a decade -- especially in the US, Europe and Japan, simultaneous bubbles in a variety of asset classes (equities, bonds and real estate), untenable public and private leverage within the system, government spending that is simply out of control worldwide and a generally clueless population about the prosperity foundational axioms of individual liberty, limited government and sound money.

Over the course of this article, I am drawing upon the teachings of Adam Smith, Von Mises and Murray Rothbard. Their writings on free markets and its invisible hand, economic/business cycles, interest rates and central banking form the backbone of Austrian economics and that's what I have used to draw my inferences.

Recession 101

Let me start with what a recession is as that's one of the most misunderstood topics in economics. A recession is a cure to the malinvestments made during an economic boom, to redirect resources to the parts of the economy, where it is needed and away from the overheated/bubble sectors. While booms and busts are inherent in almost all economic activity, the frequency as well as the amplitude are accentuated by the effects of central banking and cheap money.

There is usually a multiplicity of factors that is associated with the formation of bubbles. But the one necessary and, perhaps, even sufficient condition is loose monetary policy. The rest are just the bells and whistles. The common thread behind the seemingly disparate bubbles -- the 2000 Nasdaq bubble, 2008 housing bubble, and the 2019/20 'currency bubble' (we will get to this later) -- is a loose monetary policy.

The bubbles also tend to get bigger with time just on account of the increased amount of money and credit circulating within the system. Consequently, the inevitable bursts also tend to be more devastating in its consequences. Perhaps, much more importantly, the so-called corrective actions taken by central banks to mitigate the effects of the bubble burst lay the foundation of the next bubble. So the Nasdaq 2000 bubble burst and 'the maestro' Alan Greenspan leaving interest rates at 1 per cent for a few years pretty much caused the 2008 housing bubble. If a few years of 1 per cent interest rates could cause the 2008 crisis, just imagine what nearly a decade of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) and QE (quantitative easing) are going to cause when the current all-but-commodities bubble bursts. The year 2008 is going to look like the proverbial Sunday school picnic.

What should the government really do in a recession? Actually nothing. Just allow the malinvestments to be liquidated in the markets. As Andrew Mellon, the treasury secretary during 1929 advised ""liquidate labour, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system"". Needless to add, it was completely ignored by the then supposedly 'free markets' oriented Herbert Hoover.

The only legitimate actions that a government should undertake during recessions would be to deregulate, cut taxes and reduce government spending to free up capital for private investments. A good historical account of such a laissez faire approach and the results thereof can be understood from Jim Grant's The Forgotten Depression: 1921: The Crash That Cured Itself.

The current solution of a fiscal stimulus is pure 'Keynesian snake oil' that just postpones the day of reckoning while compounding the problems at the same time. A good metaphor that can be used to understand recession is that of a drug addict on an artificial high and the withdrawal symptoms while trying to quit the habit. The equivalent of the drug is the central bank sponsored cheap money, the highs are the asset price booms and the withdrawal symptoms are the equivalent of a market induced recession. It's just a necessary cure to clear the system.

What Caused The Great Depression?

Most of what is popularly believed about the causes of the Great Depression is just plainly wrong. In fact, they are deliberately falsified versions of economic history for governments to absolve themselves of the blame and provide a justification to usurp greater powers. Interested readers can read the Murray Rothbard classic America's Great Depression to understand the details.

Summarising the propaganda, it is that the stock market crash of October 1928 was a normal business cycle downturn. What made the downturn a prolonged major depression was a passive/deflationary monetary policy and a laissez faire attitude of the Herbert Hoover government. As Ben Bernanke summarised in a 2002 lecture in honour of Milton Friedman ""Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again"". There's remarkable agreement amongst the Keynesians and the Monetarists on this issue.

Am I saying that Bernanke is deliberately lying on the causes of the Great Depression? I wouldn't be surprised if that were indeed to be the case. But, perhaps, a more systemic rationale for such explanations is that the economists, who are appointed to positions of power and influence are the 'useful idiots'.

But as Rothbard explains, the truth is very different. The US Fed blew up a stock market bubble during the 'roaring twenties'. When the bubble burst, as all bubbles eventually do, Hoover and later Franklin Roosevelt repeatedly intervened in the market with all kinds of actions including wage and price controls, the New Deal, confiscation of gold and destruction of output to artificially raise food prices.

The US Fed did indeed play a relatively passive role as they should have, but the depression was eventually blamed on the deflation. The economic truth, however, is that the deflation made the depression a lot more tolerable than would have been otherwise.

Since most people associate deflations with depressions, I should point out that the entire nineteenth century in which the US when it rose from a backward agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse was deflationary. The gold standard that produces one of the remarkable objectives of ""growth with reducing inequalities"" is deflationary, almost by definition.

The Crisis Ahead

The nature of the crisis that lies ahead for the US economy is quite unlike what we have witnessed in the last few decades -- at least in a developed economy. The bubbles will burst -- equity, bond and real estate -- and there is some evidence that this process may already have begun in the last few weeks.

But what prevents the US Fed from undertaking another round of QEs and ZIRP to blow some air back into these bubbles? Perhaps just an increased quantity of QE should do the trick this time around.

Also, there doesn't seem to be any major side effects to these QEs anyway in the form of inflation. Why can't Jerome Powell do just what Donald Trump suggested and focus on growth?

Firstly, I have very little doubts that both the interest rates hikes as well as the current QT (quantitative tightening) programme will be reversed by the US Fed very soon. The first signs of recession should be obvious even to the Fed early next year, and by the middle of 2019, we should well be into the process of returning to ZIRP as well as QEs. But unlike the first rounds of QE, the effects on asset classes are going to be very different this time around. Why so?

As Jens O Parsson describes in his book, Dying of Money, ""everyone loves an early inflation. The effects at the beginning of inflation are all good. There is steepened money expansion, rising government spending, increased government budget deficits, booming stock markets, and spectacular prosperity, all in the midst of temporary stable prices. Everyone benefits, and no one pays.""

Which is pretty much what happened from 2008 to 2018. All of the inflation created by the central banks went directly into the good assets of equities, bonds and real estate. The result of the QEs and ZIRP was ""one big, fat, ugly bubble"" as candidate Trump correctly identified. As shown in the graph below the valuations of equities is so extreme that on a relative basis, commodities are cheaper today than in 1971.

So what happens next? Continuing with Parsson's thesis on the inflationary cycles, ""...the latter effects (of inflating the money supply) patiently wait. In the terminal inflation, there is faltering prosperity, tightness of money, falling stock prices, rising taxes, still larger government deficits, and still soaring money expansion, now accompanied by soaring prices and the ineffectiveness of all traditional remedies. Everyone pays and no one benefits.""

And that's what will happen with QE4 to QE(N). A repeat of the 1970s stagflation (inflation combined with a recession) in which the traditional central bank remedies cease to work. A legitimate question at this stage would be that ""if the problem is similar to the one during the 1970s, then why not the solution adopted during the 1970s?""

The reason is debt. The national debt of the US government was less than a $1 trillion in 1980 and most of it was financed through 30-year treasury bonds. This allowed the then Fed chairman Paul Volcker to hike the US Fed funds rate to 22 per cent to quell the inflation. That accumulated a national debt of $1 trillion, which took more than 100 years since the formation of the republic to reach, the US government now adds in a single calendar year.

Given that the current debt is in excess of $21 trillion and will increase at the rate of $1.5-$2 trillion a year (the Congressional Budget Office projections do not factor a recession for the next 10 years), even at 5 per cent interest rate, the US government finances would resemble that of Italy's.

Also given that almost the entire debt is ARM's (adjustable rate mortgages), the US economy doesn't have the legs to afford 'a Volcker'. This brings us to the currency bubble that I had alluded to early on in this article.

The End Game

""It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one"" -- Barry Eichengreen

The ability to issue currency is an enormous privilege and all central banks have abused that to varying degrees. The US Fed by virtue of the US dollar being the world's reserve currency has had the opportunity to abuse that privilege the most. When the recession hits the US economy, and it's very likely to do so in 2019, the choices in front of the US Fed would be quite stark:

a. Continue the path of hiking rates as well as QT, albeit at a subdued level.

b. Abandon the normalisation process and revert to ZIRP and QEs.

The above choices are on the monetary side. From the fiscal as well as regulatory side, we know that the political class will rely far less on the 'invisible hand' of the markets and much more on the heavy hand of the governments. There's little doubt that Trump and 'a Sanders' (the most likely successor in the event of a recession in 2019) would make Hoover/Roosevelt look like laissez faire presidents by comparison.

If you think the current $1.5 trillion fiscal deficit under Trump is large, just wait for a few years and this number will look small in comparison.

The choices on the monetary side, however, will have much greater impact on the future course for the US dollar. If the US Fed continues path (a) -- the tightening route -- then a repeat of the Great Depression is on the cards.

Given the nature of imbalances and the virtual dismantling of the manufacturing sector in the US economy, the recession is likely to be worse than it was during the 1930s. But the silver lining would be that the US dollar will survive.

Make no mistake, quite unlike the 1930s, the US dollar will lose a substantial portion of its value vis-a-vis sound money, ie gold. But it will survive to fight another battle, another day.

But everything we have seen over the last few decades since the days of Volcker points to path (b). The remarkable consensus amongst the economists as to the cause of the Great Depression as well as the seeming success of ZIRP/QE as a response to 2008 (as pointed out earlier, all that ZIRP/QE 1, 2, 3 has managed to postpone the day of reckoning while making the causative problems of debt and leverage substantially bigger) does indeed guarantee QE4 to QE(N).

What this would lead is to make the other central banks question the currently undeserving status of the world's reserve currency granted to the US dollar. It should (whether it does, I am not sure) also make the citizens of every country question the role of their individual central banks in debasing their individual currencies. One of the properties of money is a store of value and these fiat currencies have amply demonstrated over the last 100 plus years that they are anything but a store of value.

I am also sure that Trump would blame the US Fed for the recession and the subsequent collapse when it starts in 2019/2020. I am also sure that some of the 'usual suspects' would be the trade war with China, Trump's tax cuts etc. But a legitimate search for an answer has to go back a lot in time. At the very least, to the days of Greenspan if not until 1971, when Nixon closed the gold window.

Personally, I would go back to 1913 as the source of the problem when the US transitioned from the classical gold standard to having a central bank that surreptitiously usurped the monetary function of the free markets. Once we crossed that rubicon, it's a long slippery downhill slope, where the result is a guaranteed destruction of the currency. The US dollar might well be on its last incline of that slope.

Unfortunate and terrible as it sounds, it could get worse. There is just too much complacency within the system for anything worthwhile to be done before the collapse. But if we do recognise the underlying issues and return to a system of limited government, individual liberty and sound money, then the crisis would well be worth it. But my guess is that we will again end up pointing the finger at all the wrong directions -- capitalism, greedy speculators, foreign mercenaries and the unregulated trading system.

The solutions then are likely to be the exact opposite of what's needed and we might well have greater capital controls, higher taxes, more bureaucracy and more aggressive alpha males on top of the governance structure.

That would be the real unfortunate part and that's the most likely outcome as well."

A day after TOI reported this major breakthrough by Crime Branch, additional commissioner (crime) Rajiv Ranjan confirmed that the orders were being placed through the dark web via Tor and I2P networks. The accused never came under the police scanner as their identities and locations remained anonymous and couldn't be tracked due to layered encryption system.

""The darknet encryption technology routes data through intermediate servers, which protect the identity of users and guarantees anonymity. The complicated system makes it almost impossible to reproduce the node path and decrypt information,"" Ranjan said. Due to high level of encryption, websites cannot track the geolocation and IP of users, and users don't get information about the host.

DCP (crime) Ram Gopal Naik said the accused youths were supplying marijuana only to their verified customers. All deals were fixed through chat platforms like DM, IMO, Instagram, Snapchat, Wickr and Hike. Payments were done in advance in the form of Bitcoins.

Sources said new users were introduced only through a verified user. The accused would Facetime with the new customer to verify his identity. If he appeared suspicious, they would cut ties and block the new user as well as the one who introduced him.

The analysis of the call records of the youths has revealed that they were supplying imported marijuana in Goa, Chandigarh, Pune, Mumbai and Kolkata, apart from Delhi.

Accused Sahil Kadyan (25), a resident of Inderpuri, is pursuing graduation from an open school. He has been consuming charas and ganja for the last 4-5 years. He used to procure it from a contact in west Delhi's Subhash Nagar. Later, he got in touch with a resident of Model Town who was importing ganja from the US. He then learnt the process of using the dark web to buy drugs. Another contact has been identified as Ando from Berlin.

Kadyan first started selling the drugs to his friends and eventually turned into a distributor. After making an advance payment to the supplier, he would give them the address to which the cartel would ship the drugs through international courier firms.

Ridham (22), a resident of Paschim Vihar in west Delhi, is a college dropout. He has been friends with Sahil for long and was a partner in the illegal business in which both had invested a large amount.

Sources said the price of this weed is over 50 times the Indian weed, which costs as low as Rs 50-100 per packet. The foreign drug is sold for Rs 2,000-3,000 per gram. ""One 500mg shatter is sold for Rs 50,000 in India. The total value of the recovered shatters is Rs 13 lakh. The value of 50 grams of cannabis wax imported from US is around Rs one lakh.

The horror of NEET continues

National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has continued to haunt medical aspirants of Tamil Nadu, particularly those from government schools. Only eight government school students managed to secure a medial seat after clearing NEET this year, according to official data. Despite setting up 412 special training centres, ineffective operation have let down the students. KA Sengotttaiyan, state school education minister, admitted that Rs 20 crore amount sanctioned remained unused and promised better performance in the coming years.

Also, many students were given centres in other states like Rajasthan since there were not enough centres set up here. Strict checking which also led to stripping in few cases took toll on mental health of few examinees. Of the 1.2 lakh candidates, around 60 per cent were unable to clear the entrance, according to official data. However, around 1,300 government school students who cleared the test were unable to obtain the necessary cutoff. With government showing no intent in clearing the bill which seeks a permanent exemption of NEET, private coaching centres have started to mushroom, collecting fees Rs 20,000-Rs 2,00,000 for a year. Some are also travelling to other states for coaching.

Revised syllabus cheers up students

After a gap of nearly 12 years, Tamil Nadu government revised school curriculum. The new textbooks, written based on the revised syllabus for state board students, have received a positive response from almost all the stakeholders. Besides enriching the content, value additions like Quick Response (QR) codes for reading reference materials, Information & Communication Technology (ICT) corners and career guidance sections have made the new textbooks better than the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), said an official from the school education department.

""The book is filled with worked-out examples, colourful illustrations and quick pointers which will help the students understand the concepts better and perform well in not only board exams but also competitive exams like NEET and IIT-JEE,"" he said.

Only one bus for Chennaiites

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy launched a total of 986 government buses this year -- 515 in July and 471 in October. However, despite the Corporation's proposal to replace 245 buses on an urgent basis, the city got just one new bus. According to official records, nearly 250 old MTC buses were declared unfit for operation. Also, more than 70 per cent of the 3,300 buses are being operated beyond the permissible six lakh kilometres.

M Chandran, vice president, Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) said a bus must ideally run for seven years. But, MTC buses have been running for more than 15 years. While the year started with the government announcing a steep hike in government and private bus fares ranging from 20 per cent to 55 per cent in January, the failure to replace rickety buses has proved in further losses to MTC, with a major chunk of commuters shifting to suburban trains for travel. When contacted, an official from MTC said that at least 50 new buses will be allocated to Chennai next year.

Now, pay your fine online

In a bid to eliminate cash transaction and ensure transparency, the city police in May this year launched a cashless fine payment system for traffic violators. Police reviewed that it is a major hit. ""From May 10 to December 27, a total of 13,92,442 cases have been registered and fine worth Rs15,44,69,930 has been collected,"" said a senior official from the traffic department. As per the new system, besides swiping cards at point of sale machines already available with traffic police, those served with e-challans can make payments online.

The fine can also be paid through Paytm using QR Code. The fine can also be paid in cash at post offices, relevant courts and state-run e-sewa centres The official further added that when offenders pay digitally, they get an acknowledgement text from the city police. ""Also, from next month, we will announce an updated portal after tying up with the National Informatics Centre (NIC). This will help us know their previous details and nab repeated offenders,"" he said.

Metro yet to become the first choice

Two underground metro rail stretches, Nehru Park to Central and Saidapet to AGDMS were inaugurated after nearly six years of construction in May, this year. The ridership of Chennai Metro currently stands close to 60,000 against the estimated five lakh. Though the inauguration of the two stretches increased the patronage from 30,000 to 60,000, it still has to go a long way. It may be noted that in December last year, Chennai Metro came under fire from the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for several discrepancies in the Detailed Project Report (DPR), it prepared for the phase- II project. Even this year, Union Urban Development Ministry had reasons to doubt the feasibility of the 107 km second phase for which the agency had sent a detailed report to avail funds. An official of CMRL said the ridership will increase once Metro is connected from AG-DMS to Washermanpet via Central.

Chennai is becoming smart

While the Smart City project implemented by the Greater Chennai Corporation made little headway in 2017, an official said as many as seven projects were completed this year and several others have begun. ""The completed projects include exclusive bicycle lane, installation of storm water drains in T Nagar, development of Namma Chennai app for GCC, establishment of 28 smart classrooms in corporation schools, park renovation, establishment of sensory park and conversion of sodium lamps into LED lamps in almost all the areas,"" said an official. While projects worth Rs 26 crore are being implemented on the ground, projects worth Rs 336 crore are in various stages of implementation. Also, work to augment the water supply to city residents and increase the volume of supply, as part of the Smart City Mission, would be underway by March next year."

With the new academic year set to commence in the next few months, there are various key decisions that are now lying in the backburner as the CM is yet to allot ministries to the newly-elected members of the assembly.

Take for instance the schedule for common entrance tests and school admissions. Last year, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had declared the schedule for all common entrance tests on December 28 and released the admission schedule for schools on December 30. However, this year, the government is yet to commence the process for the same. ""The release of the schedule will take another 2-3 weeks. We have to wait before the minister of education department is appointed,"" said Papi Reddy, chairman of TSCHE, adding that there won't be much of loss as there is sufficient time before the exams are held.

Finalising of a committee to issue notification for fee fixation of professional courses also lies pending. ""First, a committee is constituted that will issue a notification calling applications from private colleges to fix the fee structure for the next three years. Once we receive applications, the same shall be audited and subsequently fee will be fixed. However, we have to wait for the minister to be appointed to seek approval on the committee,"" said Rama Rao, consultant at Telangana Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC).

Other aspects such as affiliation process for intermediate colleges and finalization of admission process for degree courses are also pending.

Making matters worse, several key positions such as principal secretary, commissioner of school education and chairman of the TAFRC also have to be finalised by the new education minister.

The delay by the chief minister has not only irked the opposition parties but also the parents community. ""The fee hike issue has been pending for the last four years. While the TRS party added the school fee issue in it's manifestos in 2014 as well this year, no results were yielded.

Trump's campaign to cripple Iran economically by imposing harsh economic sanctions and force either changes in Iran's regional policies or even better, regime change, have gotten off to a relatively slow start. With much of the international community pledging to salvage the 2015 international agreement that curbed Iran's nuclear program after Trump withdrew from the deal in May, the United States is discovering that enforcing the sanctions that aim to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero, cripple its shipping industry, and cut the Islamic republic out of the international financial system is easier said than done. While Iran will likely feel significant pain, Europe, China, and Russia have pledged to soften the blow to the degree possible by continuing to purchase Iranian oil, invest in the Islamic republic and create mechanisms to do business in currencies other than the US dollar.

The jury is out on whether that persuades Iran that the advantages of sticking to the nuclear agreement outweigh the disadvantages. That in turn could depend largely on Europe's ability to ensure that Iran is not excluded from the Brussels-based Society for the Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) international financial messaging system used by more than 10,000 banks worldwide for their more than 30 million transactions a day or is able to create one or more special purpose vehicles to which China, India, South Korea, Japan, and Turkey, who accounted for 70 percent of Iran's oil exports in 2017, would have access.

A Stuttering Start

President Trump's severe economic sanctions appeared to be manoeuvring an obstacle course even before they kicked in on November 5 despite US estimates that the measures had already led to a reduction of Iranian oil exports from 2.7 million to 1.6 million barrels a day. The impression that the sanctions were getting off to a modest start was reinforced by the fact that the United States gave eight countries, including the major importers of Iranian oil -- China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - 180-day waivers that, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, had already reduced their purchases from the Islamic republic. China, India, South Korea, Japan, and Turkey accounted for 70 percent of Iranian oil exports in 2017.(3) Earlier the US Treasury issued a license that allows an Iranian-backed gas field in the North Sea that accounts for three percent of Britain's gas supply to keep operating.(4)

Pompeo said the waivers were designed to ""ensure a well-supplied oil market."" He mentioned two of the eight countries had pledged to reduce their imports to zero within the six-month period of the waiver, while the other six had agreed to ""greatly reduced levels.""(5) Trump defended the waivers, saying he was going slow on the imposition of the sanctions to prevent shocks in the oil market and a spike in prices. ""I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market. I don't want to lift oil prices,"" Trump told reporters.(6)

The United States has also trumpeted the fact that the sanctions sparked the collapse of the Iranian currency, the rial, wreaking havoc on the average Iranian. Unemployment is shooting up, especially among the country's youth, inflation is spiralling higher because of the cost of imported goods, and there have been water and power shortages due to a lack of infrastructure investment after years of on-again, off-again sanctions.(7) Raising fears that Iran would ration fuel and hike prices, the government in December reintroduced fuel cards to put a halt on smuggling of up to 40 million litres a day.(8) Smuggling of other subsidized goods such as pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs as well as non-subsidized items like textiles has reportedly increased sevenfold in recent months.(9)

The Trump administration hopes the sanctions will complicate the Iranian support for groups like Lebanon's Hezbollah Shiite militia and the Houthis in Yemen, as well as its military operations in Syria by forcing the Islamic republic to reduce military spending. It bases its hope on the fact that in the decade prior to the lifting of sanctions as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement, Iranian military spending dropped by 30 percent, ""one of the highest percentage decreases in military spending globally,"" according to Iranian researchers Sajjad F. Dizaji and Mohammad Farzanegan.(10)

The researchers argued that the difference in the sanction regime prior to the agreement and the current US measures is that the Trump administration's sanctions are unilateral rather than multilateral. ""While unilateral sanctions are not shown to influence Iran's military burden significantly, the impact of multilateral sanctions is negative and statistically significant,"" Dizaji and Farzanegan said. Military expenditures, moreover, account for only three percent of Iran's gross domestic product.(11) Even so, the International Crisis Group concluded that the period of multilateral sanctions and reduced military expenditure ""coincided with what many consider the most significant expansion of Iran's military intervention in the region.""(12)

Reality Kicks In

The implication of Trump's and Pompeo's remarks on waivers was that increased production by suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, while compensating for the reduced Iranian oil sales, could spark a fight for market share, which could fuel price increases. They also suggested that the United States believed that there was currently not oil in the market to replace Iranian crude. The United States' assumption appears to be that Iran, a country with a long experience in circumventing sanctions, may have an oil industry that remains robust despite its travails.

The waivers recognized that the countries involved had no immediate alternative sources for oil. Three of the eight waiver recipients -- Greece, Italy and Turkey -- are members of NATO. Japan and South Korea have mutual defense treaties with the United States and play key roles in the North Korea denuclearization initiative. India, the world's largest democracy, is crucial to the administration's Indo-Pacific strategy, which seeks to unite countries in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness. China is the largest importer of Iranian oil. Forcing it to seek alternatives would have sparked shock tremors in the market.

US officials attribute their apparent success in already reducing Iranian exports to the strength of their alliances and the fact that countries and companies do not want to risk being barred from access to US markets.(13) Japan and South Korea stopped buying Iranian crude ahead of the sanctions. Japan nonetheless negotiated a waiver for 100,000 barrels per day, down from the 165,000 barrels it was buying prior to the threat of US measures while South Korea was granted a quota of 200,000 barrels a day.(14) The two countries said they were looking to renew imports in January.

India is officially asserting that it is importing at the agreed rate of 360,000 barrels per day.(15) By the same token, Indian claims that it had significantly reduced imports prior to the waiver are countered, says energy analyst Ellen R. Wald, quoting TankTracker com. The online monitor of oil tankers reported that Indian oil imports from Iran remained virtually unchanged in recent months. Iranian exports are frequently hidden by tankers that make stops at multiple Gulf ports and at times shut down their responders to camouflage their movements. ""The data on oil movements show conclusively that Iran's oil exports have not decreased nearly as much as the media narrative has suggested... Oil speculators and the Trump administration have been led to believe that the threat of impending sanctions on Iran's oil is removing so much from the market that oil prices could skyrocket to $100 per barrel this year. The actual data on Iran's oil exports contradict this,"" Wald said.(16)

Moreover, relatively unnoticed was a non-oil related waiver granted to India that allows it to maintain its infrastructural investment in the Iranian port of Chabahar on the shore of the Arabian Sea, a mere 70 kilometres from the Chinese-backed Pakistani port of Gwadar.(17) The port would facilitate Indian links to Central Asia by bypassing arch rival Pakistan, contribute to economic development in Afghanistan and pre-empt Chinese efforts to gain a foothold in Chabahar. Similarly, there is no indication that the US will sanction Russian, Chinese, and European companies assisting Iran with its nuclear sites, Fordow, Arak, and Busher.(18)

China is one joker in the pack. It negotiated a waiver for 360,000 barrels per day but retains the right to production from fields in Iran in which Chinese companies have a stake. They include China National Petroleum Corp's (CNBC) 75 percent stake in Iran's MIS and the North Azadegan oilfield. China moreover has a history in busting sanctions against Iran. In the years prior to the nuclear agreement, China used the Bank of Kunlun, established in 2006 in its troubled, oil-producing north-western region of Xinjiang as its handler of Iranian oil payments in violation of US and UN sanctions. The bank was sanctioned by the US Treasury for its business with Iran, including transferring funds to Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Kunlun in October halted yuan and euro denominated payments from Iran in anticipation of the US sanctions.(19)

Turkey is another joker. Refusing to bend to the US sanctions would enhance its goal of exploiting its geography to become a gas and oil transit hub. To do so, Turkey will have to extend its current gas agreement with Iran that risks losing its Turkish market share to producers like Qatar, Russia Azerbaijan and the United States. The question is whether Iran can make a gas agreement sufficiently attractive in terms of pricing as well as facilitating Turkish objectives in Syria where it is determined to stymie Kurdish aspirations.

Payments and pricing are but one, albeit the most immediate issue. Longer term, Iran will face significant difficulty if it can't secure the technologies to enhance production from its predominantly mature oilfields. Iran currently uses out-of-date technologies like pumping natural gas into the old oil fields to produce ever-dwindling amounts of oil. That is likely to become untenable with retail, commercial and industrial gas consumption on the rise. Countries like China and Russia are unlikely to meet standards of technologies developed in the United States and Europe."" As long as Washington can prevent it from obtaining vital enhanced oil recovery technologies, Iran's economy will become increasingly fragile,"" said energy scholar Micha'el Tanchum.(20)

The November sanctions constituted round two. Earlier sanctions imposed in August targeted Iran's steel, aluminium and auto sectors by limiting access to raw materials and essential parts. They prompted together with the prospect of the November sanctions major European companies like Total, A.P. Moller-Maersk, Peugeot, Renault, Airbus, Alstom and Siemens to withdraw from Iran. ""There is a primacy of the (US) political system. If that primacy is 'This is what you are going to do,' then that is exactly what we are going to do. We are a global company. We have interest and values and we have to balance both,"" said Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of German industrial conglomerate Siemens.(21) Put more forcefully, Pompeo's special advisor on Iran, Brian Hook, quipped: ""If you are the CEO of a European company and you are given the choice between doing business in the United States market or the Iranian market, that is the fastest decision you will ever make as CEO.""(22)

With Iran pushing Europe to put in place mechanisms to counter the US sanctions, European leaders are struggling to neutralize the measures while ensuring that European entities are shielded against being barred from the US market for doing business with Iran. European authorities have so far to convince the continent's companies that they are able to do so.

Walking a Tightrope

If the withdrawal of European companies is one indication of the difficulty in countering sanctions, SWIFT, the financial messaging system, is another. SWIFT is caught between a rock and a hard place. The Trump administration has so far refrained giving it a waiver. As a result, SWIFT's board of directors made up of representatives of major international banks risk being slapped with travel bans and asset freezes if the organization continues to do business with Iran.

To counter the US threat, the European Union invoked in July a blocking statute that makes US court decisions and administrative actions regarding sanctions on Iran void in Europe. It also prohibits Europe-based firms from discontinuing their business ties to Iran due to foreign sanctions.(23) The blocking statute was intended to not only shield European companies but also convince Iran that it was in its interests to remain committed to the nuclear accord.

""It's a difficult exercise because the weight of the U.S. in the global economy and financial system is obviously relevant. But we are determined to preserve this deal,"" said European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.(24) How difficult is evidenced by the fact that European measures have so far failed to produce convincing results. Without referring to the US sanctions, SWIFT said in early November that it was disconnecting an undisclosed number of unidentified Iranian banks.(25) Some 30 Iranian banks are connected to SWIFT. The impact that a disconnection from SWIFT would have was evident in 2012 when SWIFT complied with UN and EU sanctions. The disconnection wiped off almost half the value of the Iranian oil sector reducing revenues from oil exports from US$92.5 billion to USS52 billion.(26)

The odds in a US-EU battle over SWIFT are, however, not unequivocally in Washington's favour. US sanctions would significantly impact the global financial system and threaten America's dominant position. ""We must increase Europe's autonomy and sovereignty in trade, economic and financial policies,"" said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.(27) Europe appears to be putting its money where its mouth is by developing a system of its own that would handle financial transactions with Iran and be immune to US sanctions. Dubbed a special purpose vehicle, the system would be open to Russia and China, both of which are signatories to the nuclear agreement, as well as other countries. European officials were also looking at a barter system that would allow Iran to sell oil and use the proceeds to purchase goods or technology from Europe.(28)

The special purpose vehicles would be designed to reduce the number of financial transactions with Iran by bundling them and to shield commercial banks by limiting their role. The advantage of multiple vehicles would allow sanctions busters to differentiate between sanctionable and non-sanctionable transactions. They could also cater to different business segments including small and medium-sized enterprises that often have no exposure to the United States, the oil industry, as well as sectors like automotive and aviation. European officials privately concede that oil traders are unlikely to avail themselves of the special vehicle(s).

The vehicles could be stand-alone state-owned banks or clearing houses for companies that transfer money to Iran, repatriate funds from the country, or engage in barter trade with it.(29) The vehicles would avoid cross-border transactions that would be easier to monitor by US authorities by arranging that a European importer of Iranian goods gets paid by a European exporter. They would further coordinate payments in ways that exporters would be paid from funds outside of Iran while importers would be paid by funds within Iran.

Iran scholar and media company owner Esfandyar Batmanghelidj and policy analyst Axel Hellman argued that Europe could kickstart its vehicle initiative with one is that is focussed on the humanitarian sector that is not included in the sanctions regime. ""Companies active in food and pharmaceuticals...have the longest-standing and arguably most important presence in Iran. Companies like Nestle, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, and Unilever -- which sell the high-volume packaged foods, cleaning products, and medicines that households depend on -- are at the heart of the most important commercial ecosystem in Iran, which includes Iran's private sector and its vibrant consumer class... Despite the exemptions for trade in food, medicine, and many consumer products, Iran's trade in these goods is restricted by the limited number of European banks willing to receive payments from Iranian importers. The SPV would serve to increase the volume of trade that can be conducted given the current state of banking ties,"" Batmanghelidj and Hellman said.(30)

The European initiative is but one effort fuelled by the threat of sanctions against SWIFT to develop alternative systems including ones using blockchain, a technology that uses cryptography, that is already being considered by Russia and Iran.(31) Russia already uses a significantly cheaper alternative to SWIFT for domestic payments and is marketing it to foreign institutions.(32) China is developing a similar system.(33)

Conclusion

The jury is out on the likely effectiveness of crippling sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States aimed at forcing the Islamic republic to alter its regional policy. Similarly, the fate of the 2015 international agreement that curbed Iran's nuclear agreement hangs in the balance after the US withdrew from the deal and re-imposed sanctions. The success of US policy and the agreement's continued viability depend on the ability of Iran's oil buyers and world powers, including Europe, China, Russia, India, Japan and South Korea to cushion the impact of the sanctions. They also depend on the degree to which the United States is forced to allow exemptions to the sanctions in its effort to balance its harsh approach towards Iran with its other geo-political concerns. The record so far suggests that Iran will endure significant pain but like in the past will be able to maintain its policy. The question is whether an opening for renewed negotiations that would address the concerns of the United States and its allies and cater to Iranian aspirations and needs will occur only when US President Trump leaves office or whether Trump may ultimately decide that talks are in the interest of both parties.

Seven tastemakers inspire us to try it

Overtourism is a fact of our times. But even as thousands descend on cities like Santorini, Kyoto and Amsterdam, others are staying away -- preferring places and signature experiences that help them slow down, savour and give time a break. Who among us didn't follow, with some envy, Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor's languid Cape Town break -- full of horseback riding, picnics on the beach and scuba expeditions? Or designer Masaba Gupta's stay at Soneva Fushi in Maldives last month, when the mood on her Instagram feed was languid. Slow travel is on the rise and, according to Amit Kalsi, Founder-CEO of New Delhi-based Experiential Travel Journeys, ""experiences like river cruises and visiting jungle retreats are getting popular"". Sesh Seshadri, Director & General Manager, Lonely Planet India, echoes this. ""Our global travel trend predictions for 2019 include getting off the tourist path, following your DNA, electric road trips, and dark skies,"" he says. While Europe and Australia are still favourites, slow travellers are increasingly finding options closer to home -- like a walking itinerary in the Himalayas that includes silent walks led by mindfulness gurus and a hike with a monk (approximately ₹8,86,560 for 16 days by Ampersand Travel). Seven industry experts and influencers let us in on their favourite experiences of 2018.

No two days in Devidayal's typical week are similar. As one of the mainstays behind award-winning restaurants The Table (that she co-owns with husband Jay Yousuf), Magazine Street Kitchen and Miss T, her time is taken up firefighting, crunching numbers and innovating. So every chance she gets, she goes scuba diving. ""It is the best way to switch off because you can't take your phone under the water with you,"" says the 38-year-old. She discovered her passion on a visit to the Andamans last year -- spotty mobile reception became a boon, allowing her to disconnect completely and ""truly hear the sounds around her"". On Beach No 5, she found an underwater world that ""forced her to stay present and in the moment"". Since then, most of her holidays have been planned around dive sites. As she gets ready for the family's annual ski-trip to Gulmarg (with low mobile coverage), I wonder if bad network also influences her travel plans. ""I think that's just a by-product; I do it to be in the outdoors,"" she laughs.

Heading a young venture -- the hotel heiress' global hospitality company is just a year old -- is time-consuming. But Nair, 36, tries to mix work and play, culling out time for water sports and long walks (often covering 25-30 km a day). In Malta, a place she keeps returning to for work, she has begun to extend her stay so she can take the time to ""immerse herself"". ""I've split my exploratory walks over many visits and have managed to go along every coastline on the island,"" she says. A stretch she loves is from Marsaskala to Marsaxlokk, which takes her past St Peters Pool, a natural swimming area reachable only on foot. Walking, she tells me, is also a great way to discover regional hideaways and engage with the locals. Though she thinks Switzerland is the best country to walk in, she is looking forward to hiking up Machu Picchu and walking up to Tiger's Peak in Bhutan.

Last year, the Neelakurinji bloomed across South India -- something that happens once every 12 years -- and Singh, 65, made sure she travelled to where the brilliant blue flowers were. ""Kodaikanal has been a favourite holiday destination since my childhood days; it always brings back nostalgic memories of carefree summers. But this trip was planned with the express purpose of 'seeing the kurunji',"" she says. The wedding planner -- who is also an avid swimmer and cyclist (holidays in Europe have seen her pedalling all day, with lunch breaks under olive trees) -- spent a week hiking in the hills. She trekked to Dolphin's Nose and Cloudlands Peak ""to disconnect from the world and be one with nature"". She is contemplating a trip to Peru and Bolivia in April and shares that a climb to Kilimanjaro is on her bucket list. But first, she is planning a trekking excursion with Carnatic signer TM Krishna -- from the plains to the top of Kodaikanal -- but without the Neelakurinji for company this time.

As the Gem Palace scion, Siddharth often travels the world looking for jewels (a recent find, according to The New York Times, was a 10-carat mine diamond at a Las Vegas antiques show). So it isn't surprising that Diamond Beach -- where ice from the glaciers around Breiðamerkursandur break up on the rocky black shore -- was a must-visit on his recent trip to Iceland, with his brother Samarth. The 34-year-old ""drove everywhere, staying in villages that had populations of just 200 people"". Slowing down also gave the avid horseman an opportunity to indulge one of his other passions. At Íslenski Hesturinn, he toured the countryside on horseback, experiencing first-hand the tölt, an ambling gait inherent to the horses raised on the island, something he says ""that only Icelandic horses do"". Though he has been to 70 countries so far, Siddharth shares that he now wants to connect more deeply with the places he visits. ""My biggest dream is to leave my phone behind, get lost and travel around Latin America.""

He heads one of the most experimental kitchens in the country, but Sadhu says, ""I've always been a mountain person and living in the city, I often find excuses to get away."" This usually takes the chef -- who has worked at Noma and French Laundry -- to Kashmir and Uttarakhand, where he forages in the wild, and brings back seabuckthorn and hisalu berries to incorporate into his menu. ""I'm a firm believer that you need to get out to find peace. Also, it really helps me think."" Hailing from Kashmir, the 32-year-old calls it home, but also the source of inspiration for the food he serves at Masque and at pop-ups all over the world. He loves the fact that you can look out at ""the entire Himalayan range, with no network, no cell phone, and all you can hear is the wind"". Does he ever take a trip to just de-clutter his mind? Kashmir pops up again -- he visited last month to think about his winter menu (which is being launched at Masque this week). ""It helps me to streamline things,"" says the workaholic, adding that it also lets him focus on the most important task: what to serve his diners.

Tewari is someone who has truly embraced slow travel. The journalist, who used to be based in Mumbai, now spends part of the year in Bali, where her daughter attends The Green School. ""Preceding slow travel is the slow mindset,"" she says, emphasising that the two go hand-in-hand. ""Whether you're travelling to a remote island, going for a yoga class, or to a healer in Bali, the idea is that it's a slow discovery of life's experiences."" Slow travel, for the 45-year-old, is an ideology ""that you have to embrace as something that is part of your day-to-day life. It's not necessarily about going to a destination, it's about everything you experience in your life, but just doing it more mindfully"". As someone who has been writing about fashion and its sociological underpinnings for over 10 years, she says, ""I don't buy much. I understand the significance of what is made by hand. I want to know the faces of the faceless artisans."" As a result, Tewari has incorporated 'slow' into her everyday routine -- from consuming less to being mindful of her daily habits.

Mehta, 47, is no stranger to long journeys and, for him, ""there's no better way to travel than a road trip"". His newest, and third, book, The Long Drive Home, details his 54-day overland trip from Munich to Mumbai in an Audi Q7. However, he picks two three-week trips he took -- one to Peru and the other to Turkey, which included ""a drive through the night from Antalya to Istanbul"" -- as some of his best slow travel experiences. ""I don't have this fear of 'Oh my God, we're never going to come to this country again, so let's pack in as much as we can in the limited time we have',"" he says. So he uses each trip to explore the land and connect with locals -- like when he was in Gaziantep, near Turkey's Syrian border, where he visited the Zeugma Mosaic Museum, befriended locals and joined them for several meals of shorba and liver kebab, in the shadow of a local masjid. It is these experiences, not found on the Internet, that inspire him to travel. Is it any surprise then that he has another trip to Turkey planned in 2019?"

Rice supplies, then, were rationed at 50 grams per head per day and it was increased to 100 grams only in 1950.

The pandemic flu of 1918 resulted in the decline of Hyderabad city population by 9.4% -- the population of Hyderabad state in the 1921 census was lower than that of 1911. There were more deaths than births and the decadal population dropped from 1.33 crore in 1911 to 1.24 crore in 1921. The flu which struck in September 1918 killed 46.5 people per 1000 that month and the death toll increased rapidly to 464 deaths per 1000 by Octoberend. Two per cent (3.50 lakh) of Hyderabad's population had been wiped out within a month.

2018 was also the year when the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), set up as Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, turned

100. It was shifted to Hyderabad in 1958.

Also completing a century was the Hyderabad Currency Act 1918 which introduced paper money for the first time. Earlier, only coins were in use. The Act came into force on June 4, 1918.

The Osmania University was also set up in 1918 though the institute celebrated the centenary in 2017.

While exams went online, campuses erupted with unrest and agitation

From reforms to resentment, 2018 was a mixed bag for students and parents. After almost two decades since its inception, common entrance tests such as Eamcet, ICET among others went online for those seeking admission to various professional courses.

In a major development, Telangana joined the national pool for medical courses by earmarking 15% of MBBS seats and 50% of postgraduate medical seats to students from other states.

What rocked Hyderabad this year was a string of student protests reported from top institutions such as Birla Institute of Technology Science, Tata Institute of Social Science, apart from other engineering colleges such as Vasavi College of Engineering, Chaitanya Bharati Institute of Technology etc. Their demands ranged from fee regulation to continuation of courses.

Those in school found no respite from the spiralling fee structure as the state government for the first time ordered school managements to maintain status-quo on the fee hike and issued an admission notification. Subsequently, on January 22, the Hyderabad High Court issued an interim order allowing schools to hike fee, leaving parents fuming. It was only closer to the end of year that the Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, decision to slash fee by 50% brought them some hope.

Apart from fees, two alleged cases of sexual abuse of primary students reported from a private school in Tolichowki, added to the angst of parents who demanded better surveillance in educational institutions.

City set to get an AIIMS, but will H1N1 deaths stop?

Right at the beginning, the government found itself in a spot with maternal deaths showing a three-fold jump since 2016-2017.

The core Hyderabad district itself reported as many as 105 maternal deaths compared to just 31 in 2017.

A worried healthcare department put all heads together and managed to bring things under control by strengthening government hospitals and introducing several health schemes, including KCR Kits, where pregnant women were given financial assistance in instalments towards the end of the year.

Fee regulation among several other issues triggered protests from students at top institutes such as TISS, BITS and many others

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) now stands at 70 female deaths per 100,000 live births. But right through the year, the government struggled to contain the deadly swine flu (H1N1) virus, with 154 deaths officially recorded till October this year and with 90% cases reported in Hyderabad city itself. If the battle to control the mutated virus was an uphill task, the dengue virus with 2,700 deaths and malaria with 1,500 deaths, underscored the government's failure to tackle diseases in Hyderabad. The health department also struggled to create more jobs and depute doctors and other necessary staff to rural areas, forcing patients to flock to Hyderabad's hospitals.

On a positive note, the decision to renovate the heritage block of the iconic Osmania General Hospital and build a new hospital premises, came as a welcome move. On December 20, Telangana received happy tidings, when the Union cabinet finally clearing the decks for the establishment of a new All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bibinagar, at a cost of Rs 1,028 crore. The new prestigious facility spread over 200 acres will also have 100 MBBS seats.

The district inspector of school (DIOS) PK Upadhyay said two schools, Cambridge School in Sector 27 and Bal Bharti School in Sector 21, have agreed to return hiked fees. While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees. The claims of DIOS that Bal Bharti School has agreed to roll back fees now only is untrue,"" Prabhakar said.

The management of the Cambridge School could not be contacted at the time of this report going to publication."

We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period -- and we're tracking every last dollar.

Today, a summer intern working in land management who makes $9.25 per hour and spends some of her money this week on mango kombucha. Note: this diary was written last summer and is the last entry in our Your Spending In Your State series.

Occupation: Summer Intern

Industry: Land Management and Development

Age: 20

Location: Kauai, Hawaii

Salary: $9.25/hour

Paycheck Amount (Biweekly): $533

Monthly Expenses

Rent: $0 (I'm living with my parents for the summer back home. It's my last summer before graduating and entering the ""real world,"" and my first one since high school that I've spent at home.)

Spotify Student: $5

Hulu Basic: $8 (I pay for this, my parents pay for Netflix, and we all have access to both accounts.)

Phone: $0 (My parents pay.)

Health Insurance: I'm on my parents' plan until I turn 26. (#ThanksObama)

College: I'm on an academic merit scholarship that covers my tuition, and other outside merit scholarships cover most of my other costs. Since my scholarship renewal is contingent on maintaining a high GPA, grades are very important to me. My parents contribute about $2,500/semester from a college fund to cover basic costs like books and transportation.

Savings: I put $500 into my Roth IRA every six months and am trying to build up my checking account for next semester, as it was decimated during my study abroad semester (I was not permitted to get paid at my internship because of my student visa).

6:30 a.m. -- I wake up and have scrambled eggs with leftover gyoza filling from last night for breakfast, along with fresh mangos from my best friend's farm and figs from our backyard! Being home for the summer makes me appreciate the wonderful things from my island that I took for granted before moving away.

10 a.m. -- Two hours into work, I have a coffee from the office Keurig and a KIND bar.

1 p.m. -- Lunch from home: shiso musubi (rice balls), leftover gyoza, takuan, and ahi poke. My mom just returned from a trip to Japan and is way too excited about using the kawaii bento accessories she picked up.

4:30 p.m. -- I fill up gas at Costco using my mom's card ($23.33). Gas here is so expensive that this is the only place we fill up for the rebate, and I don't have my own Costco card.

5 p.m. -- Finish work and stop at my local juice shop to pick up a mango kombucha. (I get 50 cents off for bringing a reusable bottle!) This company supports a total of 30 local farms on the island and only sells reusable bottles. And their workers are the sweetest! $4.50

5:15 p.m. -- I go for a three-mile run along the ocean. Not paying for a gym, plus killer views, and occasional whale spottings make me wonder why I go to college on the East Coast.

8 p.m. -- Mom and I cook sukiyaki and brown rice for dinner with fresh watercress on the side, and I pack the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

6:30 a.m. -- I wake up and see that my grades from my semester abroad came in! I did well in most of my classes but got one unexpected B. I shoot off emails to the professor and my advisor while eating an avocado and chicken sandwich for breakfast. (The avocados are free from our friend's farm.)

7:30 a.m. -- I call my best friend from study abroad on my way into work to vent about the grade. She's the best and I miss her.

9:30 a.m. -- Office Keurig coffee and leftover KIND bar for snack.

1 p.m. -- Leftover sukiyaki and rice for lunch with a raw egg. A coworker went to a Filipino restaurant nearby and brought back cascaron for dessert, and another coworker brought in homemade matcha ice cream!

5 p.m. -- I meet my dad after work for our favorite hike and we trail run three miles up and down the mountain. He is 56 and still kicks my ass.

7:30 p.m. -- I make beef, broccoli, salad, and brown rice for dinner for my dad, my grandma, and myself. (My mom is working.) Afterwards, I read more of Labor of Love by Moira Weigel, a really interesting book about the history of dating that I'm renting as a free library eBook!

6:30 a.m. -- Wake up and eat breakfast: avocado sandwich on whole grain again with fresh mango.

7:30 a.m. -- I study economics and love that there are so many accessible, well-made, and free podcasts available on the topic! I listen to Planet Money on my way into work.

12 p.m. -- I'm selling a bathing suit that doesn't fit me properly on eBay, so I run to the post office during lunch. I make $152 after fees and spend $28.78 on expedited shipping for the buyer, so I net $123.22.

12:15 p.m. -- I'm tired of Japanese food, so I go to the Costco food court (my happiest place) and get a chicken bake for lunch. I also grab a free strawberry guava juice from the company fridge. $2.33

5:30 p.m. -- There's a swell on the south side of the island, so I meet up with my dad after work and we surf until the sun goes down. When we get out of the water, we realize someone has stolen our car keys! This has never happened to us before on the island, and it's super disappointing. We call a friend to bring us a spare.

9:45 p.m. -- By the time our friend comes and we get back to our side of the island, everything but fast food is closed. I'm starving and exhausted, so I go through the Taco Bell drive-through and get a cheesy potato burrito. $3.68

6:30 a.m. -- Up and at 'em! I have cereal with chopped apples and bananas from our friend's farm and fresh pineapple.

8 a.m. -- Get to work and make a Keurig coffee.

12 p.m. -- I go on a lunch run with my boss and she treats me to a pineapple tea. I eat leftover beef broccoli and brown rice for lunch.

5:30 p.m. -- I stop at my local juice shop to pick up more kombucha. Mango mint jalapeño for me and strawberry guava for my mom. I get a free shot of ginger juice, cinnamon, lemon, and honey. $9

6 p.m. -- I would usually go for a run now, but I'm exhausted, so I FaceTime with my friend instead. He is interning in Silicon Valley this summer, and I try to convince him to use that sweet tech cash to come visit Kauai for a weekend.

7:30 p.m. -- I treat my friend to dinner as a thank you for driving 90 minutes roundtrip to bring us our keys last night. My parents have a date night, so I bring my grandma with us as well. We go to her favorite sushi restaurant and order miso soup, seaweed salad, three rolls, and green tea. $77

8:30 p.m. -- I crack open my AFOQT book for an hour. I'm studying to become an officer in the Air Force after graduating - I want a break after undergrad before hopefully going to law school. I also feel strongly that our military should be more diverse, and I'm ready to put my money where my mouth is.

5:30 a.m. -- I wake up early for a phone interview for a fall internship at a cool start-up. It goes well, and I'm excited about the prospect! Afterwards, I eat a BLT with avocado from our friend's farm and some honeydew melon.

7:30 a.m. -- New Freakonomics Radio episode! The drive to work flies by.

8 a.m. -- Work! My coworker gives me the top of a pineapple we ate yesterday and suggests I try to plant it in my house. I do some research and decide to give it a try.

12 p.m. -- Our office is playing tennis today! And my coworker brought in Chinese chicken salad and homemade banana lumpia for everyone for lunch.

5 p.m. -- I go home and help my mom prep for the dinner party we're throwing to thank our farmer friends for all of the recent goodies - five of our good friends come over and we make slow roasted salmon, garlic risotto, chicken masala, eggplant parm, and a caprese salad! I've typically only come home for a couple of weeks every year since I graduated high school because my college is so far away, so spending time with my family and friends feels absolutely amazing.

8 a.m. -- I wake up and text my friends about breakfast. My friend's roommate from college is visiting Kauai for the first time, so we go to our favorite local diner and order loco mocos, oxtail soup, and banana macadamia nut pancakes to split. $15.08

11 a.m. -- We stop at our favorite local boutique to check out the new arrivals, but I ate too much at breakfast and feel too bloated to try anything on. We go for coffee at another local shop and I get an iced coffee. $3.05

12 p.m. -- I get home and nap, clean, and watch a few episodes of The Handmaid's Tale on Hulu. I read the book a few years ago and loved it, and the show is just as good!

6 p.m. -- It's Bon Dance season -- a Buddhist summer festival that we look forward to every year. I meet a friend and we drive down to the Bon Dance with my grandma in tow. (She's too old to dance now, but likes to sit and watch.) We dance for hours while snacking on shaved ice, daikon, musubi, and nishime. As per tradition, the church provides free dinner for dancers.

10:30 p.m. -- I get home, finish up the leftover risotto, and sleep. After studying abroad, living a more chill lifestyle has been exactly what I need.

8:30 a.m. -- It feels so nice to sleep in! I make avocado toast for breakfast.

12 p.m. -- It's a family tradition to do a deep clean every Sunday, so I help out by scrubbing the toilets and folding towels.

2 p.m. -- More of The Handmaid's Tale! I'm officially hooked.

5 p.m. -- My dad, mom, grandma, and I pile into the car and drive to the south side. Grandma is stoked to see a couple of monk seals chilling on the shore! We swim for a while and then go to our favorite hot dog place, where I get a Polish dog with Lilikoi mustard and mango relish and then chocolate gelato for dessert ($12, Mom pays). I'm so lucky to have parents that can afford to have me home for the summer.

8 p.m. -- We drive home. I hop in the shower and then scroll through Instagram before going to sleep."

It is early morning in early summer, and I am tracing my way through the woods of central North Carolina, steering cautiously around S-curves and braking hard when what looks like a small rise turns into a narrow bridge. I am on my way to meet Tami McGraw, who lives with her husband and the youngest of their kids in a sprawling development of old trees and wide lawns just south of Chapel Hill. Before I reach her, McGraw emails. She wants to feed me when I get there:

""Would you like to try emu?"" she asks. ""Or perhaps some duck?""

These are not normal breakfast offerings. But for years, nothing about McGraw's life has been normal. She cannot eat beef or pork, or drink milk or eat cheese or snack on a gelatine-containing dessert without feeling her throat close and her blood pressure drop. Wearing a wool sweater raises hives on her skin; inhaling the fumes of bacon sizzling on a stove will knock her to the ground. Everywhere she goes, she carries an array of tablets that can beat back an allergy attack, and an auto-injecting EpiPen that can jolt her system out of anaphylactic shock.

McGraw is allergic to the meat of mammals and everything else that comes from them: dairy products, wool and fibre, gelatine from their hooves, char from their bones. This syndrome affects some thousands of people in the USA and an uncertain but likely larger number worldwide, and after a decade of research, scientists have begun to understand what causes it. It is created by the bite of a tick, picked up on a hike or brushed against in a garden, or hitchhiking on the fur of a pet that was roaming outside.

The illness, which generally goes by the name 'alpha-gal allergy' after the component of meat that triggers it, is a trial that McGraw and her family are still learning to cope with. In much the same way, medicine is grappling with it too. Allergies occur when our immune systems perceive something that ought to be familiar as foreign. For scientists, alpha-gal is forcing a remapping of basic tenets of immunology: how allergies occur, how they are triggered, whom they put in danger and when.

For those affected, alpha-gal is transforming the landscapes they live in, turning the reliable comforts of home ­- the plants in their gardens, the food on their plates - into an uncertain terrain of risk.

In 1987, Dr Sheryl van Nunen was confronted with a puzzle. She was the head of the allergy department at a regional hospital in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia, and had a reputation among her colleagues for sorting out mysterious episodes of anaphylaxis. This time, a man had been sent to see her who kept waking up, in the middle of the night, in the grip of some profound reaction.

Van Nunen knew at once that this was out of the ordinary, since most allergic reactions happen quickly after exposure instead of hours later. She also knew that only a few allergens affect people after they have gone to bed. (Latex, for instance - someone sensitive to it who has sex using a latex condom might fall asleep and wake up in the midst of an allergy attack.) She checked the man for the obvious irritants and, when those tests came up negative, took a thorough look at his medical history and did a skin test for everything he had eaten and touched in the hours before bedtime. The only potential allergen that returned a positive result was meat.

This was weird (and dismaying, in barbecue-loving Australia). But it was the only such case Van Nunen had ever seen. She coached the patient on how to avoid the meals that seemed to be triggering his reactions, put it down mentally to the unpredictability of the human immune system, and moved on.

Then a few more such patients came her way. There were six additional ones across the 1990s; by 2003, she had seen at least 70, all with the same problem, all apparently affected by meat they had eaten a few hours before. Groping for an explanation, she lengthened the list of questions she asked, quizzing the patients about whether they or their families had ever reacted to anything else: detergents, fabrics, plants in their gardens, insects on the plants.

""And invariably, these people would say to me: 'I haven't been bitten by a bee or a wasp, but I've had lots of tick bites,"" Van Nunen recalls.

In her memory, Tami McGraw's symptoms began after 2010. That was the year she and her husband Tom, a retired surgeon, spied a housing bargain in North Carolina, a development next to a nature reserve whose builder had priced the big houses to sell. The leafy spread of streams and woodland pockets was everything she wanted in a home. She didn't realise that it offered everything that deer and birds and rodents, the main hosts of ticks, want as well.

She remembers one tick that attached to her scalp, raising such a welt the spot was red for months afterwards, and a swarm of baby ticks that climbed her legs and had to be scrubbed off in a hot bath laced with bleach. Unpredictably, at odd intervals, she began to get dizzy and sick.

""I'd have unexplained allergic reactions, and I'd break out in hives and my blood pressure would go crazy,"" she told me. The necklines of all her T-shirts were stretched, because she tugged at them to relieve the feeling she couldn't take a deep breath. She trekked to an array of doctors who diagnosed her with asthma or early menopause or a tumour on her pituitary gland. They prescribed antibiotics and inhalers and steroids. They sent her for MRI scans, pulmonary function tests, echocardiograms of her heart. Nothing yielded a result.

Looking back, she realises she missed clues as to the source of her problem. She always seemed to need to use an asthma inhaler on Wednesdays - the day she spent hours in her car, delivering steaming-hot dinners for Meals on Wheels. She would feel short of breath, and need to visit an urgent-care clinic, on Saturdays - which always started, in her household, with a big breakfast of eggs and sausages.

Then a close friend had a scary episode, going for a run, arriving home and passing out on the hot concrete of her driveway. Once she was recovered, McGraw quizzed her. Her friend said: ""They thought I got stung by a bee while I was running. But now they think maybe I have a red-meat allergy.""

McGraw remembers her first reaction was: That's crazy. Her second was: Maybe I have that too.

She Googled, and then she asked her doctor to order a little-known blood test that would show if her immune system was reacting to a component of mammal meat. The test result was so strongly positive, her doctor called her at home to tell her to step away from the stove.

That should have been the end of her problems. Instead it launched her on an odyssey of discovering just how much mammal material is present in everyday life. One time, she took capsules of liquid painkiller and woke up in the middle of the night, itching and covered in hives provoked by the drug's gelatine covering.

When she bought an unfamiliar lip balm, the lanolin in it made her mouth peel and blister. She planned to spend an afternoon gardening, spreading fertiliser and planting flowers, but passed out on the grass and had to be revived with an EpiPen. She had reacted to manure and bone meal that were enrichments in bagged compost she had bought.

She struggled with the attacks' unpredictability, and even more with the impact on her family. ""I think I'm getting better, and then I realise I'm not,"" she says. ""I'm more knowledgeable about what I can and can't do.""

The discovery of new diseases often follows a pattern. Scattered patients realise they are experiencing strange symptoms. They find each other, face to face in a neighbourhood or across the world on the internet. They bring their experience to medicine, and medicine is sceptical. And then, after some period of pain and recalcitrance, medicine admits that, in fact, the patients were right.

That is the story of the discovery of CFS/ME and Lyme disease, among others. But it is not the story of alpha-gal allergy. An odd set of coincidences brought the bizarre illness to the attention of researchers almost as soon as it occurred.

The story begins with a cancer drug called cetuximab, which came onto the market in 2004. Cetuximab is a protein grown in cells taken from mice. For any new drug, there are likely to be a few people that react badly to it, and that was true for cetuximab. In its earliest trials, one or two of every 100 cancer patients who got it infused into their veins had a hypersensitivity reaction: their blood pressure dropped and they had difficulty breathing.

That 1-2 per cent stayed consistent as cetuximab was given to larger and larger groups. And then there was an aberration. In clinics in North Carolina and Tennessee, 25 of 88 recipients were hypersensitive to the drug, with some so sick they needed emergency shots of epinephrine and hospitalisation. At about the same time, a patient who was receiving a first dose of cetuximab in a cancer clinic in Bentonville, Arkansas, collapsed and died.

The manufacturers, ImClone and Bristol-Myers Squibb, checked every obvious thing about the trial: the drug's ingredients, the cleanliness of the manufacturing plants, even the practices at the medical centres where cetuximab had been administered. Nothing stood out. The most that researchers could guess at the time was that the unlucky recipients might have some kind of mouse allergy.

Then the first coincidence occurred: a nurse whose husband worked at the Bentonville clinic mentioned the death to Dr Tina Hatley, an immunologist in private practice in Bentonville. Hatley had recently finished postgraduate training at the University of Virginia's allergy centre, and she mentioned the death to her former supervisor, Dr Thomas Platts-Mills.

The bad responses to the drug looked like allergic reactions, and they were common enough - and far enough from the manufacturer's expectations - to be an intriguing research opportunity.

Platts-Mills pulled together a team, looping in Hatley and several current research fellows as well. Fairly quickly, they discovered the source of the problem. People were reacting to the drug because they had a pre-existing sensitivity, indicated by a high level of antibodies (called immunoglobulin E, or IgE for short) to a sugar that is present in the muscles of most mammals, though not in humans or other primates. The name of the sugar was galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, known for short as alpha-gal.

Alpha-gal is familiar to many scientists because it is responsible for an enduring disappointment: its ability to trigger intense immune reactions is the reason that organs taken from animals have never successfully been transplanted into people. The puzzle was why the drug recipients were reacting to it. To have an allergic reaction, someone needs to have been primed with a prior exposure to a substance - but the trial recipients who reacted badly were all on their first dose of cetuximab.

Team members scrutinised the patients and their families for anything that could explain the problem. The reactions appeared regional - patients in Arkansas and North Carolina and Tennessee experienced the hypersensitivity, but ones in Boston and northern California did not. They investigated parasites, moulds and diseases that occur only in pockets of the USA.

Then Dr Christine Chung, a Nashville researcher recruited to the team, stumbled on an intriguing clue. Almost one in five of the patients enrolled at a cancer clinic at her hospital had high levels of IgE to alpha-gal. But when she checked those patients' near neighbours, treating them as a control group - that is, people who lived their lives in the same way, but did not have cancer and had no reason to have received the drug - almost one in five had antibodies to alpha-gal as well.

Almost a decade later, that correlation still makes Platts-Mills chuckle. The alpha-gal reaction ""had nothing to do with cancer,"" he says. ""It had everything to do with rural Tennessee.""

The question then became: what in rural Tennessee could trigger a reaction like this? The answer arose from a second coincidence. Dr Jacob Hosen, a researcher in Platts-Mills's lab, stumbled across a map drawn by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showing the prevalence of an infection called Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It exactly overlapped the hot spots where the cetuximab reactions had occurred.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is transmitted by the bite of a tick: Amblyomma americanum, one of the most common ticks in south-eastern USA. It's known as the lone star tick for a blotch of white on the back of the female's body.

The researchers wondered - if the mystery reactions shared a footprint with a disease, and ticks caused the disease, could ticks be linked to the reactions too?

It was an intriguing hypothesis, and was reinforced by a new set of patients who came trickling into Platts-Mills's clinic at about the same time. They were all adults, and that was odd to start with, because allergies tend to show up in childhood. They had never had an allergic reaction before, but now they were experiencing allergy symptoms: swelling, hives and in the worst cases anaphylactic shock. They too had high levels of IgE antibodies to alpha-gal.

None of them, though, were cancer patients. They told the physicians that they had no proof of what was causing their reactions - but more than a few of them sensed it had something to do with eating meat.

Dr Scott Commins, another postgraduate fellow in Platts-Mills's group, took it upon himself to phone every new patient to ask whether they'd ever suffered a tick bite. ""I think 94.6 per cent of them answered affirmatively,"" he says. ""And the other few per cent would say, 'You know, I'm outdoors all the time. I can't remember an actual tick that was attached, but I know I'd get bites.'""

Meat from mammals inevitably contains alpha-gal - so in already sensitised individuals, eating meat might constitute a second exposure, in the same way infusing cetuximab had been.

If tick bites had sensitised them, then the alpha-gal reaction might be a food allergy as well as a drug reaction. But the connection was speculative, and cementing cause and effect would take one final, extraordinary coincidence.

As it happens, Platts-Mills likes to hike. One weekend he took off across the central Virginia hills, tramping through grassy underbrush. He came home five hours later, peeled off his boots and socks, and discovered his legs and feet were speckled with tiny dots. They looked like ground pepper, but they were dug into his skin - he had to use a dull knife to scrape them off - and they itched something fierce. He saved a few, and sent them to an entomologist. They were the larval form of lone star ticks.

This, he realised, was an opportunity. As soon as the work week started, he had his lab team draw his blood and check his IgE levels. They were low to start with, and then week by week began to climb. Platts-Mills is English - his father was a Member of Parliament - and in the midst of having his IgE tracked, he went to an event at the Royal Society of Medicine in London. ""And at that point,"" he says cheerfully, ""I ate two lamb chops and drank two glasses of wine.""

In the middle of the night, he woke up covered in hives.

The lone star tick doesn't receive much attention in the USA. It's the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, that has the dubious honour of being the most well-known, as it's the carrier of Lyme disease, which causes an estimated 300,000 cases of illness in the USA each year.

The lone star tick doesn't transmit Lyme disease, but is the vector for other serious illnesses, including Q fever, ehrlichiosis, Heartland virus, Bourbon virus and tularaemia, an infection so serious that the US government classifies the bacteria that cause it as a potential agent of bioterrorism.

While Lyme clusters in the north-east and the northern Midwest, the diseases carried by Amblyomma stretch from the coast of Maine to the tip of Florida, the Atlantic to the middle of Texas, and the southern shores of the Great Lakes all the way to the Mexican border.

And that range appears to be expanding. ""The northern edge of where these ticks are abundant is moving,"" says Dr Rick Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, north of New York City. ""It is now well-established further north, into Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York and well up into New England.

""Climate change is likely playing a role in the northward expansion,"" Ostfeld adds, but acknowledges that we don't know what else could also be contributing.

It's a universal complaint among tick scientists that we don't know as much about ticks as we should. Tick-transmitted illnesses are more common in the USA than mosquito-borne ones - according to the CDC's most recent accounting, in 2017 tickborne diseases were 2.6 times more common than when the agency began counting in 2004 - yet it's mosquitoes that receive the most public health attention and funding, from national surveillance programmes to local mosquito-control campaigns. (In fact, the CDC was founded in 1942 because of mosquito-borne disease; its original title was the Office of Malaria Control in War Areas.)

What is known about where ticks live, what they feed on, and how they are affected by changes in land use and climate has mostly been assembled out of the findings of scientists fighting for scarce research funding.

It's impossible to talk to physicians encountering alpha-gal cases without hearing that something has changed to make the tick that transmits it more common - even though they don't know what that something might be.

The lone star tick is a sturdy, stealthy predator. It isn't picky about conditions - it tolerates the damp of Atlantic beaches, and its western expansion only stopped when it ran up against the Texas desert - and it's content to feed from dozens of animals, from mice all the way up the tree of life.

It loves birds, which might have helped it move north so rapidly, and it has a special lust for the white-tailed deer that have colonised American suburbs. And, unlike most ticks, it bites humans in all three stages of its lifecycle: as an adult, as a nymph and as the poppy seed-sized larvae that attacked Platt-Mills, which linger on grass stalks in clusters and spring off hundreds at a time.

Ticks detect scent with organs embedded in their first pair of legs, and what they're sniffing for is carbon dioxide, the exhaled breath of an animal full of warm oxygenated blood. When lone star ticks catch wind of it, they take off. ""The Lyme disease tick is a slow tick,"" says Dr William Nicholson, a microbiologist at the CDC. ""Amblyomma will run to you.""

There has been so little research into alpha-gal allergy that scientists can't agree on exactly what stage of the bite starts victims' sensitisation. It is possible that a fragment of a previous blood meal, from a mouse, bird or deer, lingers in a tick's guts and works its way up through its mouth and into its human victim. It's also possible that some still-unidentified compound in tick saliva is chemically close enough to alpha-gal to produce the same effect.

One aspect of its epidemiology is becoming clear, though. The allergy isn't only caused by the lone star tick.

In Australia, Van Nunen (who is now a clinical associate professor at the University of Sydney School of Medicine) couldn't understand how her patients' tick bites solved the mystery of their meat allergy. But she could see something else. The beaches that fringe the coast north and south of Sydney are rife with ticks. If bites from them were putting people at risk of a profound allergy, she felt compelled to get the word out.

In 2007, Van Nunen wrote up a description of 25 meat-allergic patients whose reactions she had confirmed with a skin-prick test. All but two had had severe skin reactions to a tick bite; more than half had suffered severe anaphylaxis. That abstract formed the basis of a talk she gave later that year to an Australian medical association, which was then indexed - but not published in full - in an Australian medical journal. It took until 2009 for the Virginia group to catch up to it, after they had already published their first alert.

That was unfortunate, because the crucial detail in Van Nunen's research wasn't just that her cases were earlier than the first round of American ones. It was that they were caused by bites from a different tick: Ixodes holocyclus, called the paralysis tick. Alpha-gal allergy was not just an odd occurrence in one part of the USA. It had occurred in the opposite hemisphere, making it literally a global problem.

And so it has proved. Alpha-gal reactions linked to tick bites have now been found in the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Norway, Panama, Brazil, Côte d'Ivoire and South Africa. These cases trace back to at least six additional tick species. (An online map on which patients list themselves includes over a dozen more countries.)

Wherever ticks bite people - everywhere other than the Arctic and Antarctic - alpha-gal allergy has been recorded. In Belgium, patients reacted badly to a drug produced in rabbit cells. In the Italian Alps, men who went hunting in the forests were more at risk than women who stayed in their village. In Germany, the most reactive food was a traditional delicacy, pork kidneys. In Sweden, it was moose.

Van Nunen herself has now seen more than 1,200 patients. ""The next busiest clinic, about 350,"" she says. Those cases have all occurred in two decades, less than the span of a single human generation. As in America, the surge leaves Van Nunen mystified as to what the cause might be. She reasons that the rise cannot be due to something in her patients; neither genetic nor epigenetic change could occur so quickly.

""It has to be environmental,"" she says.

It's a sunny early morning at the University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill. Commins, who moved here in 2016 to become an associate professor, has 11 patients to see before the end of the day. Seven of them have alpha-gal allergy.

Laura Stirling, 51, is fretting over a list of questions. She does not live nearby; she flew down from Maryland, drawn by Commins's reputation. In 2016, she found a fat lone star tick attached to her, and afterwards had fierce indigestion whenever she ate or smelled pork - a challenge, because her husband likes to tinker with a smoker on weekends. In 2017, she was bitten again, and her symptoms worsened to midnight hives and lightheadedness that sent her to her doctor's office. She immediately cut all meat and dairy from her diet. A year later, she wants to know if she can add anything back.

""Can I eat dairy?"" she asks. ""Can I cook dairy? Can I eat it if it doesn't have animal rennet in it?"" She pauses. ""I've been symptom-free, because I don't take risks.""

Commins walks her through a protocol he's developed, a method for adding back mammal products one dose at a time. He has a hypothesis that alpha-gal reactions are linked to the fat content of food; that might explain why they take so many hours to occur, because the body processes fat via a slower metabolic pathway than protein or carbs.

He recommends that patients start with a spoonful of grated dry cheese, because its fat content is low, and graduate by slow steps up to full-fat yogurt and milk and then to ice cream. If those foods don't provoke reactions, he suggests tiny doses of lean meat, starting with deli ham.

Stirling lights up at that. ""I dream of charcuterie,"" she sighs.

Because Commins was part of Platt-Mills's earliest research, he has been seeing alpha-gal patients for more than a decade now. He estimates he has treated more than 900 men and women; five new patients arrive every week. He has coached a significant number of them back to eating some mammal products and managing their exposures to the things they can't handle, so their worst experience is hunting for an emergency Benadryl, not being rushed to the ER.

Not every patient can do this. Julie LeSueur, who is 45 and lives in Richmond, Virginia, has been monitored by Platts-Mills for four years. (He is one of several doctors she has seen for the condition, after years of severe stomach issues escalated to repeated attacks of anaphylaxis that put her in hospital. One physician, frustrated she wasn't getting better, told her: ""This is all in your head."")

What started as an allergy to meat expanded into reactions to anything with an animal connection, including gelatine in medications and animal products in cosmetics, and then to sensitising her immune system to an array of other irritants, from nuts to mould. She buys vegan soap and shampoo, has prescriptions formulated by a compounding pharmacy, and mostly works from home to avoid unintended exposures. Reluctantly, she cut back a hobby that meant the world to her: fostering animals that have been rescued from abuse.

""I'm at home all the time now,"" she tells me by phone. ""I'm lucky to get off the couch.""

Commins and Platts-Mills named alpha-gal allergy a decade ago, and Van Nunen saw her first patient 20 years before that. A lab test for the allergy, the one that Tami McGraw received, has been on the market since 2010. (Platts-Mills and Tina Hatley, now Merritt, share the patent.) That makes it hard to understand why patients still struggle to be diagnosed and understand the limits of what they can eat or allow themselves to be exposed to. But alpha-gal allergy defies some of the bedrock tenets of immunology.

Food allergies are overwhelmingly caused by proteins, tend to surface in childhood and usually trigger symptoms quickly after a food is consumed. Alpha-gal is a sugar; alpha-gal patients tolerate meat for years before their reactions begin; and alpha-gal reactions take hours to occur. Plus, the range of reactions is far beyond what's normal: not only skin reactions in mild cases and anaphylaxis in the most serious, but piercing stomach pain, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea as well.

But alpha-gal reactions are definitely an allergy, given patients' results on the same skin and IgE tests that immunologists use to determine allergies to other foods. That leads both Van Nunen and Commins to wonder whether the syndrome will help to reshape allergy science, broadening the understanding of what constitutes an allergy response and leading to new concepts of how allergies are triggered.

Merritt, who estimates she has seen more than 500 patients with alpha-gal allergy, has it herself; she has had bad reactions to meat all her life, since being bitten by seed ticks at Girl Scout camp, and was re-sensitised by a lone star tick bite last year. She is sensitive enough to react not only to meat, but to other products derived from mammal tissues - and as she has discovered, they are threaded throughout modern life.

The unrecognised dangers aren't only sweaters and soaps and face creams. Medical products with an animal origin include the clotting drug heparin, derived from pork intestines and cow lung; pancreatic enzymes and thyroid supplements; medicines that include magnesium stearate as an inert filler; vaccines grown in certain cell lines; and other vaccines, and intravenous fluids, that contain gelatine.

""We have enormous difficulty advising people about this,"" Van Nunen says. ""Sometimes you have to sit down for seven hours, write seven emails and have four telephone conversations to be able to say to a 23-year-old woman who's about to travel: 'Yes, you may have this brand of Japanese encephalitis vaccine because they do not use bovine material. The vaccine is made in [cells from] the African green monkey and I have looked up that monkey and it does not contain alpha-gal.'""

Some replacement heart valves are grown in pigs; they may cause alpha-gal sensitisation that could trigger an allergy attack later. And cardiac patients who have alpha-gal allergy seem to use up replacement heart valves more quickly than normal, putting them at risk of heart failure until they can get a replacement.

There's also a growing sense that alpha-gal may be an occupational hazard. Last year, researchers in Spain treated three farm workers who developed hives and swelling and had difficulty breathing after being splashed with amniotic fluid while they were helping calves to be born. All three of them - a 36-year-old woman, a 56-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man - already knew they had alpha-gal sensitivity, but had never imagined that skin contact would be risky.

Commins has treated hunters who developed reactions after being splashed with blood after field dressing deer; those cases raise the possibility that meat-processing workers could be at risk. In the two main Facebook groups where patients gather, it's common to hear school cafeteria workers fret about reactions from breathing the fumes of meat cooking.

Last summer, researchers working with Commins reported that people with alpha-gal allergy may have greater allergic reactions to the stings of bees and wasps, potentially endangering landscapers and other outdoor workers.

It's hard to know how many people may be sensitised to alpha-gal without knowing it. A project at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that studies unexplained occurrences of anaphylaxis found last year that 9 per cent of the cases weren't unexplained after all: they were alpha-gal patients whose sensitivity had never been diagnosed.

Platts-Mills points out that the prevalence of high levels of alpha-gal IgE in his earliest studies was up to 20 per cent in some communities, ""but that was absolutely not the prevalence of allergic reactions to meat,"" he says. ""So there are clearly plenty of people out there who've got the antibody but don't have this syndrome.""

What this all means is that there are almost certainly people for whom a meat-containing meal or medical intervention could trigger an alpha-gal reaction of unknown severity.

There may be further peril awaiting them. In June, Platts-Mills and other researchers revealed that more than a quarter of patients who came to the University of Virginia's medical centre for cardiac catheterisation, to clear out life-threatening blood-vessel blockages, were sensitised to alpha-gal without knowing it.

The patients with the undetected allergy had more arterial plaque than the ones without, and, most worrisome to the researchers, their plaques were of a type that is more likely to break away from the arterial wall and cause heart attacks and strokes. Though the research is early - done in one group of 118 patients, in a known hotspot for alpha-gal - Platts-Mills worries it presages a risk for heart disease that is larger than anyone expects.

When a new disease surfaces in the USA, it's usually the CDC that investigates, pouring epidemiologists and data scientists into the field to track down connections and bring back samples for lab analysis. But investigation of alpha-gal is caught in a bureaucratic quirk of federal science. The CDC is responsible for infections spread by insects and arthropods - but alpha-gal syndrome is not an infection. That makes it the responsibility of NIH - which has abundant lab scientists, but no shoe-leather disease detectives.

NIH does seem to be taking an interest. In June 2018, it hosted an invitation-only one-day IgE-mediated Meat Allergy Workshop; in the past, such meetings have indicated the giant agency is considering launching a research programme. But just reading the workshop's programme provides a hint of how new alpha-gal research is; participants called the problem by multiple different names, displaying that there isn't even yet any agreed nomenclature for it. Similarly, the US-run universal search engine for journal articles, PubMed, indexes papers on alpha-gal under ""allergy to galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose"", ""mammalian meat allergy"", ""delayed red meat allergy"", ""galactose-α-1,3-galactose syndrome"" and more.

Platts-Mills was one of the workshop's invited speakers and gave the opening statement. Commins was there as well, along with researchers from New York, Germany, South Africa and Sweden.

Dr Marshall Plaut, who convened the meeting and is now chief of the Food Allergy, Atopic Dermatitis, and Allergic Mechanisms Section at NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, describes it as the earliest step in possibly committing to a research programme. (Platts-Mills and Commins have already received some NIH funding.) ""It signals that NIH has some interest in understanding more about the disease,"" he says. ""There are a lot of things that need to be understood.""

In August, Commins gave a talk on alpha-gal allergy at the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases, a conference held every two or so years and sponsored by the CDC that often surfaces the earliest signals of illnesses that are destined to become big problems.

The CDC's director of foodborne illness was in the audience; so was its director of vector-borne diseases, the department that deals with ticks. Afterwards, they both zoomed up to ask him questions. ""I kind of had the impression this was just a weird, small thing,"" Dr Lyle Petersen, the vector-borne director, told him. ""But this seems like kind of a big deal.""

With NIH and the CDC paying attention, research into alpha-gal might be reaching a threshold, a moment at which isolated investigations might coalesce into answers. For the patients, who feel isolated too, that can't come soon enough."

Charlie Munger, (Interview with BBC, 2012- taken from Chapter 14- Big Mistakes, The Best Investors and Their Worst Investments, Michael Batnick, Bloomburg Publishing, May 22, 2018- John Wiley)

If you are like 99% of all citizens, you earn your money each day by working at an occupation. There are all kinds of jobs in the world and one is fortunate if you are able to have a profession that you enjoy doing. Most people do not like their jobs but they have to pay the bills, so you endure and cope with the job as best as one can. As I started my working life as a school teacher, I very much understand the trials and tribulations of earning a wage and how difficult it is for nearly everyone. When you put in long hours at work and have interaction with the public, there are bound to be some stressful moments. Naturally, it can affect how you perceive your compensation. Typically, and for these very good reasons, most people understand how difficult it is to earn money and to not waste it. The reason why many people turn to the stock market is it has a history of helping people build their wealth over a long period of time. In fact, stock ownership has been the highest returning asset class over extended durations. There is, however, the key point that over a shorter interval, lets call it one year to five years, anything can happen.

As most people learn from the disclaimers, past returns are no guarantee of future success. With that said, the last three months have been tremendously difficult for anyone owning stocks. If one includes what has taken place across the globe, the last year might rank as one of the hardest environments to make money as any one year time frame in the last century. The Great Depression and bursting of the internet bubble were very tough as well, but let's be clear, it has been quite painful to be an owner of a piece of a public company, especially last week. When an asset class loses seven percent of its value in five days or less, that is quite painful. Make no mistake, I am right there with you in terms of understanding the magnitude, severity, and economic pain by owning stocks. However, let's take a step back and refresh our historical memory to provide some further context.

The initial quote from Mr. Munger is a reminder that if you want to own stocks, you have to be prepared to endure the difficult periods. It may not seem like it from the last three months, but as we lengthen the time frame out, three years, five years, ten years and more, a piece of business ownership will reflect the profitability of the business and the ability to grow those profits. Many factors can affect what transpires in a short time frame, as can be seen by what took place during the downturn in 2008. Much of that was related to poor lending decisions in the home mortgage area over the preceding three to five year period. Stocks lost nearly half their value in a year, and had recovered half of the loss in one year, and all of it in the next two years. Mr. Munger lost almost 65% of the value of his investors capital in the 1973-74 time frame, and recovered all of it the following year. He and Buffet subsequently built Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) into the 500 billion dollar enterprise it is today. Historically, some recoveries are quicker than others, for example, the crash in 1987 was recovered in less than nine months. So, as equity owners, if you own good businesses with strong managements, a solid business model, and plenty of cash flow and income, there is a very strong possibility that the recent losses are not permanent. Let's ponder the selloff and some reasons for its cause, and what might be in store for stocks as we look out a few months.

First, all over the globe investors have been losing money in nearly every asset class. Each situation is different, but if an enterprise or individual is borrowing capital to make investments, there is the risk of having to sell holdings to cover liquidity needs. With one week to go in the year, taxes are a factor for every entity, so taking losses to be tax efficient is standard operating procedure for any company in the financial services area. Last week, when the Federal Reserve Chairman raised interest rates by twenty five basis points, he indicated that two more hikes in 2019 were still on the table. Investors hated the way Powell communicated the rate hike at his press conference because there was very little recognition of the weakness in recent earnings reports from large companies. Yesterday, with no budget for 2019 in place, the disagreement over funding for a border wall cemented the reality that certain parts of the federal government will be closed.

The trifecta of a rate hike, messaging dilemma, budget failure, along with Secretary of Defense Mattis resigning, spelled disaster for equities. In sum, anything that could go wrong did, along with some seasonal issues. However, in a week the year will be over, and the tax loss issue goes bye bye. It also wipes the slate clean all over the globe as well. There will probably be some pressure early in 2019 for funds which are getting redemption's from their investors. It will take a month or so to digest that issue as well. As we move deeper into January, earnings reports will start rolling in. The selloff has reduced the hurdle rate for many companies to have operating results that investors will find acceptable enough to not sell off their stock, because, low and behold, that's already happened. So as we get through the first quarter and move into spring, if the economy holds up and doesn't go into recession, which is almost priced in now, a boring but steady market would be the ideal scenario for equities to claw back their lost ground. However, there is that little issue of the ding dong politicians.

Over a long time frame, our inept representatives aren't going to affect how a specific company will perform. They do impact all kinds of matters which affect the market, think trade, taxes, interest rates, budgets, etc. Investors see the progress, or lack thereof, and sell first and ask questions later. Clearly that already took place. With gridlock imminent, the political circus probably isn't going away any time soon. At some point they will solve the budget impasse and the closed parts of the government will reopen. As an individual investor, you can control your actions and mental approach.

Staying healthy, remaining positive, paying attention to the companies you own and how their businesses evolve, and being tax efficient are all constructive steps to having a long term approach that reduces the inclination to run and hide when things are difficult. It is unrealistic to expect anyone to have anywhere near the success of someone like Mr. Munger, but we certainly can learn from his counsel regarding approach and temperament, can't we?"

Reddy said after formation of new State of Telangana, the TRS government has streamlined the fee reimbursement and also created separate accounts for professional and inter, degree colleges for releasing funds.

Fee reimbursement arrears for the academic year 2017-18 have been almost released and the government is ready to reimburse fee for academic year 2018-19.

He reminded the managements that no college of Narayana and Sri Chaitanya were given permission since 2014 and said that in fact 60 of them have shut their shops in the State.

Prof. T Papi Reddy, Chairman, Telangana State Council of Higher Education extended his support in resolving issues of private degree and PG colleges.

During meeting, the degree college managements wanted the government to hike and fix the minimum tuition fee at Rs.20,000 for non-lab courses and Rs.25,000 for lab courses.

They also wanted the government to bring educational institutions under non-commercial slab for electricity beside reduction of municipal taxes. The school managements urged the government to relax norms for obtaining fire and police no objection certificate."

The students demanded an annual hike, based on inflation and cost of living. They haven't seen a hike for the past four years, they claimed. Holding placards, they formed a human chain from the main gate to the administrative building.

The institutes included International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Raman Research Institute (RRI), Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST) and Bangalore University (BU).

Vivek Sharma, 28, chairman of the Student Council at IISc said, ""We demand Rs 50,000 for junior research fellows pursuing PhD, from the current Rs 25,000, and Rs 56,000 for senior research fellows from the existing Rs 28,000, which has not been increased since 2014. We also want annual increments based on inflation and cost of living.""

They pointed out that some of the married researchers had the responsibility of supporting their spouses, aging parents and children. ""My wife is back home and luckily, is supported by my parents. We don't have children but some research scholars have to pay their children's school fees, and sustenance becomes difficult with the paltry sum they get,"" he added.

Students pursuing their Masters demanded Rs 22,500 from the existing Rs 12,400, which was last fixed in 2014. Undergraduate students haven't seen a hike since 2008, and their stipend has remained Rs 5,000.

There are 4,000 research scholars in IISc alone, among who around 2,500 are pursuing their PhDs. ""We have submitted our demands to the director and he agreed to forward it to the Department of Science and Technology, ministry of Human Resources Development and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. The institute's hands are tied in this matter, we're told. We also want timely disbursal of funds,"" he said.

Gaurav Solra, 21, an undergraduate physics student, said that they get Rs 5,000 only for the first three years.

Monmun Bhasin, 26, is a Computational Biology PhD student. ""I get Rs 25,000 as a junior research fellow and don't live on campus. I have to pay rent with that money and also have medical bills as I have health issues,"" she said. There was no response from the director's office on this agitation by the students."

Hundreds of contingent paid workers (CPWs) at Department of School Education, Kashmir (DSEK) get meager monthly salary -- ranging from Rs 25 to 100.

However, few among them, mostly land donors are being paid maximum of Rs 1500 a month.

Waheeda Begum, a CPW, despite donating land to the education department to get a sufficient amount is been given a meager salary of Rupees 100 a month to work for 6-7 hours a day.

Appointed in the year 1988, widow and a mother of four, Begum has been serving the Government Middle School (GMS) Chakpath Laripora in South Kashmir's Anantnag district for a meagre amount of Rs 100 which compelled her elder daughter to quit studies in her 9th standard years back.

45-year-old Begum who works in the school as a sweeper from past 30 years while narrating her ordeal of miseries said, ""My father had donated land of 9 Marlas to the education department who in return was promised of a decent salary by appointing any of our family members as a sweeper in the same school constructed in our land, but the department never adhered to their promises and keep on deceiving us by giving a meager amount as my salary.""

She said that her late father Mohammad Ramzan Bhat had also served the same school for many years and he was also been given just Rs 10-25 a month.

""When I was appointed as a sweeper in the schools after my father's death in the year 1988, the education department started giving me 100 rupees a month and till date, no hike has been given by the department, she added.

Similarly, another land donor, 27-year-old Bilquis Akhter of Redwani area of south Kashmir's Kulgam district said that she was appointed as sweeper 8 back and since then she is getting Rs 50 salary a month despite donating 4 Kanal's of land.

She said, ""The Government Middle School (GMS) which is clubbed with another school in Hamdapora village of the district has been constructed in our land but we are been victimized by the education department who is providing me Rs 50 salary a month.""

Chairman of All J&K Contingent Paid Workers cum Cook Employees Union, Nazir Ahmad said that there are at least 7898 CPW's in Kashmir province and 12,500 in the state.

He said there are very few such employees who are being paid Rs 1000-1500 a month which is the highest pay for them.

""There are hundreds of CPW's who are working in the department since the 1990s and are being paid just Rs 25 a month and even there are some unqualified workers who have been engaged in the department since 1980s who are also given the same amount.

Peerzada Firdous Ahmad of Kawari village in north Kashmir's Kupwara district said, ""I was engaged as a CPW in the year 2008 with a pay scale of Rs 35 per month and I am supposed to work for 6-7 hours a day in the schools.""

""There would have a hundred times better outcome if I would have utilized the land for farming purpose rather than donating it to the education department who tricked me to snatch it,"" Firdous said.

He said, ""The School Education Department (SED) is paying chillers and peanuts to us (CPW's) on the name of salary as the majority of us are getting Rs 25, 35, 50 or 100 from the department""

Likewise, another CPW, Nazir Ahmad Khan of Mangam Harshidnar village of north Kashmir's Baramulla district was appointed as a Contingent Paid Worker (CPW) in the year 1997 and is been given Rs 25 salary a month.

Khan said, ""I have donated land of 9 Marlas where government constructed Middle School (MS) in Wagoora zone. The education department that time had promised me of a job with a decent salary which never came true; rather I was humiliated by the department who is paying me Rs 25 a month since 21 years.""

Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK), Ghulam Nabi Itoo said, ""They all are CPW's. We held a meeting with Chief Education Officers (CEOs) in which we asked them to give us complete the documents cases wise so that the department will benefit the deserving land donors as per SRO-520.""

When asked Itoo said, ""I think the deserving land donors must be benefited according to new SRO, but there again raises an issue because some of the CPW's, are claiming their lands, but we are not got any file or documental proof regarding land in their concerned CEO offices."""

Stocks Crumble To 14-Month Lows","investing.com",FALSE,"(Thursday Market Close) Whether it's the Fed hinting at more rate hikes or Congress talking about a possible shutdown in Washington, it seems like the market just can't catch a break this week.

One day after getting rattled by the Fed raising rates and sounding less dovish about 2019 than some investors might have hoped, the market fell another 2% Thursday as a budget agreement appeared to unravel in Washington. Weak guidance from Conagra (NYSE:CAG) might have been another factor driving stocks down to new lows for the year and to their lowest levels in 14 months, while another bleak day in the crude market continued to drive fears of possible declining economic activity around the world.

There weren't too many other headlines today to account for the big plunge, and shutdowns haven't really hurt the market much in the past. Still, it was another sign of political uncertainty that some bearish investors could potentially hang their hats on, along with the ongoing China tariff battle and the unresolved Brexit situation.

Looking at it from a sector perspective, only utilities saw any gains Thursday. Consumer discretionary was the worst performer, dropping more than 2%, but consumer staples wasn't far behind due in part to pressure from a double-digit drop in CAG shares. The food packaging company reported mixed results for the quarter, but it appears to be its guidance that might have really hit shares.

Who Will Buy?

With the S&P 500 (SPX) down about 14% from the all-time high posted last fall as it entered Thursday's session, there just hasn't seemed to be much buying interest lately. That appeared to be the case again Thursday, with few people apparently willing to step up and catch what lately has been a falling knife. That could help explain why markets keep plunging every day. Even in normal times, there are always people selling, but in normal times, more people are ready to buy. That's apparently not happening so much these days.

One school of thought claims that the Fed is partially responsible for this because it continues to see two rate hikes last year and many in the market had come into yesterday hoping for one or none. On the other hand, the Fed also said a lot of good things about the economy, and the market didn't seem to listen.

Wherever people might stand on that issue, it does seem to be the case, more often than not, that when Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks, the market goes down. It hasn't happened every time since he took over the top position early this year, but perhaps often enough that investors might want to consider being extra careful on days when Powell is on the calendar. The fact is, Powell is going to be holding press conferences at every Fed meeting from now on, so that might suggest more volatility ahead, at least based on past experience.

Speaking of volatility, there's no break from that, either. The VIX ""fear gauge"" jumped double-digits to above 28 today, the highest it's been since October.

First Signs of Panic, But That's Not Necessarily All Bad

Ever since the market started getting soft in October, it's been a pretty orderly process on the way down. Selling has mostly been slow and methodical as the S&P 500 Index (SPX) dropped hundreds of points from highs above 2940 less than three months ago to where it is now hovering below 2500.

That changed on Thursday in a big way. We saw panic today, and when things get panicked, it can sometimes indicate chances of a sell-off losing steam. That's not to say there's been a bottom, only that the market did come back pretty strongly late in the session in a kind of whip-saw move before getting slammed again in the very last minutes.

People sometimes ask how one defines panic. Well, it's like Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said about another subject: It's hard to describe it, but know it when you see it. When the SPX fell quickly on Thursday from being down 30 points to suddenly being down 60, panic seemed evident.

Some might be surprised to hear this, because maybe it feels like the market has been panicking for weeks. That's understandable. However, the methodical, orderly pattern held up until Thursday.

That raises the question of what's next? Looking ahead to next week, we have a holiday-shortened trading schedule and probably some thin volume. While there aren't any guarantees, thin volume can sometimes be a precursor for upward activity. When investors return from the next two holiday weeks to a new calendar year, they'll get some data almost immediately on December payrolls and wages.

After that, we'll start to see earnings. The bulls are likely hoping that CEOs could come on the earnings calls and say things aren't as bad as they look. Of course, it could go the other way. Either way, it's arguably important to get to earnings, because even though data is nice to have, it's backward looking. At this point, with stocks getting buried almost every day, some forward-looking perspective from the corporate world might be useful. Companies have been saying lately that they've seen strong business in the U.S. but slowing activity overseas, so investors might want to consider staying tuned to see if there's any change to that and whether CEOs see opportunity once earnings season gets underway in mid-January.

Getting back to Thursday and looking for positives, it might be constructive that the dollar index fell moderately to below 97. Recently, a strong dollar has arguably been one weight on the stock market. The Fed backtracking from a three-hike outlook down to two for next year might have helped provide some of the greenback pressure.

At the same time, 10-year Treasury note yields clawed back to 2.8% after falling under that level for the first time since May. There's been some talk lately that the 45-basis point fall in yields over the last three months or so might be a boost for the home builder market, and sure enough, those stocks have flattened out a bit lately after getting slammed for weeks. Also, emerging market stocks seem to be seeing signs of a possible rebound, but any chance for that probably depends on some sign of major progress in the China tariff situation.

Though she didn't share the division, this amounts to roughly Rs 142 crores in welfare handouts per year.

But the reality in the tea gardens of the state remains grim.

The tea industry is the second largest employer in India. In its ranks are 3.5 lakh workers from North Bengal. Crippled by starvation, unemployment, low wages, inadequate medical facility and to top it off corruption, the lives of plantation workers here has turned into a brewing cup of misery.

The picturesque tea gardens in the Dooars region of Bengal spread over Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts account for 330 registered big tea gardens where 186559 families reside.

The tea business that witnessed a boom in the mid-1990s is now facing an existential crisis. As per Tea Board data, the number of tea plantations in north India, including in Bengal and the seven northeastern states, had scaled up from 3141 in 1994 to 36836 in 1999. In the Dooars alone, this number went up from 168 to 532 during this period.

But the cost of running many of these major plantations shot up and an increasing number of them were shut down over the past decade. This led to many second-generation workers losing their jobs. Uneducated and in search of a living, many turned to breaking stones to make money.

Out of the 32 defunct tea gardens across the Dooars, the condition of Nirpania tea garden in Alipurduar is reportedly the worst. Madhu, Bandapani, Dheklapara, Lankapara and Dimdima tea estates have also been shut down for years. With no immediate chance of re-opening, the workers are staring at a bleak future. Taking advantage of their destitution, local contractors, who operate within the closed tea estates, have started exploiting the workers by paying salaries as low as Rs 70 a day.

In August this year, thousands of workers finally decided enough was enough and under the banner of 'Joint Forum of Trade Unions' went on strike demanding a hike in their minimum wages.

Currently, the prevailing daily wage is Rs 159, whereas the prescribed minimum wages for unskilled agricultural workers in West Bengal is fixed at Rs 244 while the MGNREGA wage is Rs 191 per day.

Following a persistent protest, the state labour department on August 29 announced a hike in the minimum wage but the new amount is still unknown. Neighbouring Assam has already proposed a composite daily wage of Rs 351.33 and sought the opinion of tea planters so that it can be finalised.

Seeking to get a similar deal in West Bengal, tea plantation workers under the banner of 'Joint Forum of Trader's Union' have called for a nationwide strike on January 8 and 9 to voice their demands.

""Neither the Centre nor the state government is paying heeds to our demands. (The ruling) TMC alleges that the CPI(M) failed to do anything for us, but the present government is also not doing anything. The government is blatantly lying. We don't get ration under Centre's flagship programme 'National rural health mission', which we used to get few months back,"" rued Mani Darnal, INTUC leader and general secretary of National Union of plantation workers.

He says the beautiful landscapes of the hills have been guarding the secret of the state government well. Although Mamata Banerjee has been lauded for her Khadya Sathi (Food Partner) scheme (under which rice is sold at Rs 2 per kg), the starvation deaths in the hills highlight a different reality altogether.

Between 2014 and 2015, over 150 starvation deaths were reported in the Dooars and despite the Tea Association refusing to comment on the subject, stray incidents of deaths often pop up from the Bengal hamlets.

Ms Banerjee rubbished the reports of deaths and said, her ""government ensures supply of foodgrains to every single individual and there is not a single person in the state who does not get food"". However, contrary to her claims, post demonetisation in 2016, workers in the tea gardens of Darjeeling have on many occasions been left to consume tea leaves in order to appease their hunger. Darjeeling, it must be underlined, alone has 38 registered tea gardens.

Not only nutrition, but the tea workers are also deprived of basic amenities such as toilets and access to clean water. Under the Plantation Labour Act of 195, the workers are entitled to basic shelter. However, most of those working in gardens are homeless, shelterless or living on leased lands.

""Whatever development CM Banerjee has been talking about must have been on paper because, in reality, we don't see anything. Foreign export has tanked and the market rates have fallen drastically. Nobody wants to invest in this business. Only the two Tata and Godrej estates are making profit. There are no proper health or educational institutions,"" says Raju Nepali, social activist.

A sliver of good news is the drop in child trafficking once rampant in the secluded parts of the Dooars. This has fallen since the introduction of state government's flagship programme ""Kanyashree"", Raju added. Under the scheme, underprivileged school going girls are given a cycle to cut down their travel time."

If you want to see an Indian farmer on screen, tough luck. You might have to buy a ticket to an international film festival. The farmer has all but disappeared from the mainstream Hindi film industry, the same industry which gave us Mother India, Do Bigha Zameen, and Upkar. While smaller films focussing on the plight of the Indian farmer have been made (and feted elsewhere), you are unlikely to know of them.

They barely get a wide release, and the entertainment media do not want to touch them - the Indian farmer and his stories simply do not appeal to the candyfloss imagination that Bollywood caters to. How can one have an item number shot in Monaco in a story about a farmer in Vidarbha?

The rural landscape itself seems to have vanished from the stories we tell on celluloid. Can you think of one big 'Bollywood' film in recent times that has featured a big star and focussed on the lives of rural Indians? There was Lagaan, but cricket was its hook. There was Kadvi Hawa last year, but did you watch it? Peepli Live, in recent memory, came closest to addressing the issues of the farmer to a mainstream audience largely due to it being an Aamir Khan production.

In this 2010 film by Anusha Rizvi, Natha, a farmer, is encouraged by his own brother to commit suicide so his family could get a loan waiver and financial compensation after his death. The news of his impending suicide somehow attracts media attention, and reporters, OB vans and all, descend upon his village to capture the drama. While Natha, now obligated to kill himself, clearly does not want to, and runs away, even as another villager away from the spotlight Hori, who digs dirt for a living, dies.

The seen and unseen stories of Natha and Hori play out in the real world in similar ways - the inability of farmers to pay off debts and therefore resorting to suicides is a narrative we hear all too loudly ahead of any election, but the underlying reasons - the unseen - of a mental health epidemic in rural India, of poor agrarian reforms, of rising input costs and diminishing returns, of fragmented land holding, are barely ever spoken of.

The plight of the farmer, though, finds itself in centre stage in the run up to any election in India. Politicians of every stripe make promises of farm loan waivers ahead of every election. But barely heard are promises to usher in long term agrarian reforms.

Farm loan waivers are like a unicorn - it is the promise of the magical that hides the realities of the practical. They are also like Andy Warhol's fifteen minutes of fame. Loans waived for now... but what next? And how do they impact the larger economy? These are the questions we will address as we dig deeper into the issue of farm loan waivers.

Competitive populism

Hours after being sworn in as the 18th Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, ending the 15-year-long drought for the Congress in the state, Kamal Nath sanctioned the waiver of farm loans up to 2 lakh rupees in the state, as was promised in the election manifesto, and announced by Congress President Rahul Gandhi in June earlier this year.

Rajesh Rajora, Principal Secretary, Farmers' Welfare and Agriculture Development Department, issued an order soon after which read, "" Madhya Pradesh Government has taken a decision to write off short-term crop loan of eligible farmers up to the limit of Rs two lakh, as on March 31, 2018, from nationalised and cooperative banks."" Rajora said an estimated 34 lakh farmers will benefit from the loan waiver whose size he pegged between Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 38,000 crore.

Gandhi tweeted soon after: ""1 done. 2 to go.""

Chhattisgarh, where Congress won as well, followed next with Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel announcing the waiver of short-term agriculture loans to the tune of over Rs 6100 crore of over 16.65 lakh farmers drawn from cooperative banks and Chhattisgarh Gramin Banks. Fulfilling another pre-poll promise, the cabinet in Chhattisgarh decided to hike the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy to Rs 2,500 per quintal.

Upon being asked if loan waiver was the best option to revive the agrarian economy, Kamal Nath, who believes farm loan waivers are ""a necessity"" had a now-familiar tune to sing: When nationalised banks can write off 40-50 percent of loans of big industrialists, why can't cultivators get the same relief? The anger of the rural-dweller has recently manifested in massive farmer protests in the both the national capital and the country's financial hub this year.

One of their most important demands - complete loan waiver. In a year marked by high-profile scams in the banking sector in the country, to the farmer, his demand doesn't sound illogical at all. Loan waivers, whether farm loan or corporate NPAs, both represent a moral hazard, true. That corporate NPAs are a different kettle of fish is not a nuance an angry farmer faced with his dire realities is prepared to understand. And what the farmer dangles before the government is his vote. One wheat farmer in Madhya Pradesh, echoing millions others, said to Reuters: ""I will vote for the party that will write off our loans."" Quid pro quo.

The election results in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are being read as a rebuke to PM Modi. The Indian Express noted, ""The Congress' relentless pursuit of boxing in the Modi government over agricultural issues seems to have paid off as out of a total of 424 rural seats in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, the BJP won just 153 seats as compared to 294 in 2013 - nearly 50 per cent fewer seats.""

With little time left before the general elections, and to ensure the support of India's 263 million farmers and their dependants, reports indicate that the Modi government may be announcing a massive loan waiver - something it has not done since coming to power - to the tune of about Rs 4 lakh crore ($56.5 billion). Congress Chief Rahul Gandhi, on Tuesday, said that if his party is elected at the centre in 2019, it would waive of all farm loans. Gandhi also said that he ""won't let the Prime Minister sleep"" till a nationwide farm loan waiver is announced. Gandhi's farm-loan-waiver promise has certainly paid the Congress rich dividends this election season.

And with a new governor at the RBI, and the possibility of tapping into the excess capital reserves of the central bank now seeming easier than it did during Urjit Patel's time, it's not hard to see what Modi's next step might be.

In a completely unpredicted development, the theme for the 2019 elections, ladies and gentlemen, is farm loan waivers.

Farm loan waivers - A brief history

Gone are the days of free television sets and gold trinkets. Farm loan waivers, it seems, are the new political currency.

Farmers make up over half the labour market in India and are crucial in elections. The first national loan waivers date back to 1990, when the union government waived Rs 100 billion ($5.6 billion) in farm loans. In 2008, the government announced another major round of loan waivers totalling Rs 650 billion, about 1.3 percent of India's GDP.

Over the following nine years, until 2017, the central and state governments waived nearly Rs 890 billion ($14 billion) in loans to 48 million farmers. Since 2017, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh have all announced (or completed the promised) farm loan waivers. Tamil Nadu, under Jayalalithaa, had done so in 2016. Karnataka, with a waiver announced of Rs 44,000 crore tops the list, with

Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra following closely behind, each with upwards of 30,000 crore rupees waived. This brand of competitive populism, ahead of 2019, has spread to Gujarat and Assam as recently as today with these states also announcing a waiver of farm loans and electricity bills.

In 2017, waivers announced in the four states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Karnataka, came at a cost of $13.6 billion. By 2019, farm loan waivers will amount to 2-2.5 percent of the GDP, or about $40 billion, said BofA-ML last year.

As Nilanjan Banik writes in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW), ""Waivers of farm loans may help any political party win an election once. For them to win an election twice, however, it is important to undertake policy measures that will make a real difference to the life of poor farmers.""

What are waivers useful for? Garnering votes. Agriculture employs nearly 45 percent of India's workforce even though its contribution to the GDP is about 15 percent.

Research studies, like Banik's, over several years have indicated over and over again that farm loan waivers are at best a Band-Aid solution and at worst instruments that engender moral hazard. Additionally, formulae to waive farm loans are not uniform across states.

Rajasthan, for example, calculates waivers based on amount of crop damaged, size of land holdings, and harvest volume. Other states have fixed limits for the amount to be waived. The UPA government 2008 waiver covered only marginal and small farmers (those holding less than 2 hectares of land). Others got a 25 percent waiver. On the flipside, many farmers who do own more than 2 hectares of land are rendered ineligible even though much of the land owned may be uncultivated.

From a macroeconomic perspective, ex-RBI Governor Urjit Patel stated that the farm loan waiver scheme ""undermines an honest credit culture, impacts credit discipline, blunts incentives for future borrowers to repay, in other words, waivers engender moral hazard.""

The RBI also warned that loan waivers will crowd out private borrowers in favour of government lenders and will worsen inflationary risks, limiting the RBI's ability to lower interest rates. His predecessor Dr Raghuram Rajan also reiterated this concern and added that the waivers often go to the ""best connected rather than to the poorest.""The Economic Times put it succinctly when it listed seven reasons why farm loan waivers do not make sense:

Politician promises taxpayer money to waive farmer's loans in exchange for his vote. Taxpayer money is then used to repay these loans thus denting the fiscal standing of the government promising these loans. Writing for Firstpost, Dinesh Unnikrishnan says, ""Since banks do not get money on time from governments, this puts them on a back foot, forcing to go slow on further lending to farmers.""

A report from Kotak Institutional Equities pointed to a strong dip in agricultural loans in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh two-three years after the announcement of waivers there. The report adds, ""While the available data does not clearly substantiate our hypothesis given the other extraneous variables like monsoon, other government initiatives, etc., back of the envelope calculations suggest a modest slowdown.

Additionally, agriculture loan growth has been broadly strong in the years prior to the announcement of a loan waiver in most cases apart from Punjab. Additionally, the growth of agriculture loans in these states has been higher than the industry average or their regions prior to the announcement under most circumstances.""

State governments that have announced these waivers have since seen their debt-to-GDP ratio increase, Unnikrishnan points.

Unfortunately, however, agriculture is a season-dependent trade. Should there be another spell of poor rains, or a glut resulting in lower market prices, the farmer is yet again saddled with loans he cannot repay, and yet again, the politician enters to cash the farmer's vote for a waiver.

Who benefits from farm loan waivers, even if for the short term?

Rich upper caste farmers. Or at any rate, farmers with access to formal bank credit, meaning farmers with some functional financial literacy. And politicians seeking power.

The work of C Shankar Rao, assistant professor at the Council for Social Development, Hyderabad, published in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW), sheds more light on this. More than 85 percent of India's farmers are either small (0.1 to 1 hectare total land farmed) or marginal (1.1 to 2 hectares). Semi-medium to large landowners constitute the remaining 15 percent of the farmer population in the country. This distinction is crucial to understand the debt-seeking patterns within the farmer community.

There are three main sources of credit for farmers: among formal sources, Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) and co-operatives; among informal sources, private money lenders (PMLs).

It should come as no surprise then that small and marginal farmers mostly borrow from PMLs as they are less likely to have anything to offer in terms of collateral to formal sector credit sources. As SCs constitute the largest chunk of small and marginal farmers, it is also them that have the smallest formal sector credit.

More than a fourth of the total credit taken by Indian farmers came at interest rates of 36 percent per annum - clearly interests levied by private money lenders. Upper castes often also have an advantage accessing cooperative credit, research has gone to show.

(It is to be noted, however, that rich SC farmers, too, do better when it comes to accessing formal credit.)

Nilanjan Banik in the EPW again: ""Loan waivers are not the solution to the farming crisis. In the year following loan waivers, small farmers lose out on three counts: lower access to formal loans, falling agricultural revenue because of higher informal loan cost, and falling agricultural productivity.""

The Times of India reported the stories of several farmers from across the country who were eligible for waivers but eventually only ended up receiving a fraction of what was promised owing to the fine print in these loan waiver schemes.

Simply put, farm loan waivers are only helpful to those who have taken loans from a formal credit source. 85 percent of the country's farmer population constitutes of small and marginal farmers, a large section of whom most often do not even have access to formal bank credit and are at the mercy of private money lenders who levy exorbitant interest rates.

Even more simply put, loan waivers impact those who are in the system. The tragedy though is that the section of the farmer population that is in direst need of help is out of the system and therefore stands to gain nothing.

PRS Legislative Research reiterated this point: ""Marginal and small farmers accounted for 82 percent of all indebted households and 56 percent of the outstanding loans by value. However, only a small proportion of the indebted marginal and small farmers had taken loans from institutional sources such as banks and cooperatives.

Informal sources such as moneylenders, family and friends accounted for 62 percent of indebted households among marginal farmers. Such farmers would not benefit from any scheme that restructures debt taken from banks and cooperatives.""

How does it impact the economy?

The fiscal standing of the governments granting these waivers suffers as a result of loan waiver schemes. Tanika Chakraborty and Aarti Gupta of IIT Kanpur, presenting their research in Ideas for India, went on to note: ""Our research provides evidence that a blanket waiver scheme is detrimental to the development of credit markets.

Repeated debt-waiver programmes distort households' incentive structures, away from productive investments and towards unproductive consumption and wilful defaults. These wilful defaults, in turn, are likely to disrupt the functioning of the entire credit system.""

Let's examine the impact on banks first. In the aftermath of every loan waiver announcement, a spike in NPAs has been observed, simply because even honest taxpayers stop repayments in the hope that their liabilities too might get included in the waiver package. A Kotak Institutional Equities report states an example: ""As we saw in Karnataka, gross NPLs in MP have been rising in recent years. It was at 8 percent in FY2017 which increased to 11 percent prior to the elections."" That phrase again - moral hazard. Moral hazard, which incentivises defaulting on loans. In Dec 2017, The Times of India reported that in some states, the default rate had increased by up to 50 percent in the aftermath of a loan waiver announcement. HFDC Bank reported a 60 percent rise in agricultural loan delinquencies in the quarter ending June 30, 2017.

Public sector banks (PSBs) will be the most negatively affected by the loan waivers. As of 2017, Nomura estimated that state-owned banks hold two-thirds of loans to be waived. The loan waivers would further exacerbate the PSBs asset quality problems and their already weakened capital levels.

The Hindu Business Line noted, ""Economists caution that farm loans waivers would widen a fiscal deficit the government has aimed to cap at 3.3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), or Rs 6.24 lakh crore. Even without the farm loan waiver, some credit rating agencies have estimated the country's fiscal deficit at Rs 6.67 lakh crore - or 3.5 percent of GDP, on muted tax collections. The loan waiver also risks deepening the malaise at public sector banks saddled with most of India's $150 billion in stressed loans.""

In its 2016-2017 annual report, the central bank cautioned against such ""unconditional bailouts"", saying they could affect fiscal credibility in the medium term. The report also noted that the benefits of the waivers were ""highly skewed and concentrated in states where concentration of land holdings was low on account of land reforms."" It added that such random policy shocks ""have an enduring impact on market borrowings of governments, as evident from past episodes of such waivers. They increase the interest rates the governments need to pay for the loans they borrow.""

As for states granting these waivers, some have already seen their fiscal deficits worsen due to the impact of the UDAY (Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana) scheme, which passed on a part of the debt burden of state electricity distribution companies onto the state government. Compromises on productive spending are inevitable - something's gotta give. The states' fiscal deficit widens, as has already been seen. As per the RBI, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) rose to 3.1 percent breaching the threshold of 3 percent GFD/GSDP ratio recommended by the Finance Commission.

What then are the alternatives to farm loan waivers?

In a nutshell, it is safe to say that farm loan waivers are nothing more than a temporary dike made of mud in the face of a deluge of problems faced by the agrarian sector. It is no more than a populist ploy aimed at getting votes. As P Sainath said, ""waivers are merely a tool, not a transformation; mechanism not a solution; relief not an answer to the greater problem.""

M S Swaminathan, Father of the Green Revolution, said in an interview to Al Jazeera, ""Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary for the revival of farming, do not provide conditions for a secure credit system in the long term.""

Even in large scale reforms, patience is a virtue. It is beyond any doubt that India finds herself in the grip of an agrarian crisis. But the need of the hour is thoughtful long-term planning. Surgery, not band-aids. To incorporate the many reforms that have been suggested is beyond the scope of this piece, and will therefore be dealt with on a follow-up piece, but let's take a quick look at some of them.

Many experts have suggested the implementation of the National Commission on Farmers (NCF). Chaired by M S Swaminathan, it recommended minimum support price for grains, protection of small farmers and addressing risks in overtaking agriculture as a profession. The commission observed that farmers need to have access over resources such as land, water, bio-resources, credit and insurance, technology and markets and that agriculture needs to be shifted to the concurrent list instead of the state list at which it is currently at.

Nilanjan Banik wrote about some reforms from a cost-benefit perspective. He wrote, ""The government can spend money for building more canals and warehouses, on rural electrification, and to operate more e-markets. Each one of these interventions comes with a cost and an associated benefit. As an economist, one would argue government should spend each additional rupee to alleviate farm distress in a way where the impact is more, with a higher benefit-to-cost ratio.""

Noting that 20 percent of India's fresh produce is wasted because of storage problems, he advocated the building of more warehouses and storage facilities. ""The National Centre for Cold Chain Development (NCCD) has estimated Rajasthan's total requirement for storing milk, fruits and vegetables at 74,889 tonnes.

Providing pack houses and trucks would cost ₹5,985 crore. The benefits in terms of the reduced wastage in milk, fruits and vegetables, are worth more than 15 times that figure."" Research also shows that e-markets could result in better prices for farmers. A similar view was echoed by researchers at ICRIER.

Fragmented land holding, depletion of water table level, poor irrigation systems, deteriorating soil quality, rising input costs and diminishing returns, the vagaries of monsoon... these are only a few of the issues faced by the Indian farmer, none of which are truly addressed by loan waivers. What loan waivers do is address a temporary problem with a temporary, and largely ineffective, solution.

For effective long term reform, and to realise the government's dream of doubling farmer income by 2022, policymakers ought to think beyond electoral politics and enact structural changes that go beyond election season rhetoric and populist schemes.

The recent farmer protests seen in Mumbai and New Delhi hint at another crisis within the agrarian community - a crisis of identity. The socio-economic transformation that India has seen post-liberalisation has largely been felt in urban India. The traditional dominance of the farming community is being threatened in the new economic order where formal education and jobs matter more than farm incomes do.

Adding to the crisis of collective identity is an epidemic of mental health disorders. Farmer suicides are tragic, this is undeniable. And most narratives tend to cite poor farm outcomes and burgeoning loans as the reasons for these suicides, sidestepping another brewing crisis within the agrarian community - that of clinical depression.

For the record, as of 2011, the latest year for which suicide data were computed, suicide mortality is lower among farmers than non-farmers (Basu, Das and Misra, EPW, 2016). Dr Neeraj Kaushal, Professor of Social Policy at Columbia School of Social Work, has gone on to note that while the economic distress of a poor harvest may no doubt contribute to the farmer suicides, it is also just as important to address the mental health problems that the community may be suffering from, but is too afraid to address.

Any reform in the agrarian sector would be incomplete if it didn't also consider the well-being - physical and mental - of the agriculturist.Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan, otherwise, would be merely lip service."

All six members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had voted for keeping the key benchmark rate unchanged, said the Minutes of the MPC meeting released by the Reserve Bank Wednesday.

The RBI had kept the repo rate -- at which it lends to banks -- at 6.50 percent in the MPC review held between December 3-5.

""Although the inflation trajectory has been revised downwards, several uncertainties persist, especially about the medium-term outlook of food inflation and oil prices. Incoming data should help clear the haziness and enable better assessment of the inflation outlook, especially regarding the permanence of the current softness in inflation prints.

""Hence, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and retaining the stance of monetary policy as 'calibrated tightening',"" said the minutes of the meeting quoting Patel who had resigned as the RBI Governor on December 10.

Should upside risks, as outlined above, not materialise on a durable basis in the coming months, there is a possibility of space opening up for policy action in due course, Patel had argued.

RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya was of the view that even as the projection for retail inflation have been revised downwards significantly, several upside risks remain.

""In my view, it is better to understand data somewhat better over the next two months...While the recent downward surprises to inflation have significantly reduced the extent of policy tightening required in future, they have not eliminated the requirement altogether. On balance, given the relatively short period of time over which inflation has softened, it is important to wait and watch,"" Acharya said in the MPC meeting.

The RBI revised downwards the inflation forecast for the second half of the current fiscal at 2.7-3.2 percent and 3.8-4.2 percent in the first half of the next fiscal beginning April, due to favourable factors including assumption of a normal monsoon in 2019.

With risks tilted to the upside, the RBI remains cautious because of several uncertainties such as risk of a sudden reversal of the unusually low food prices, impact of MSP, oil price trajectory, volatile financial markets, elevated inflation expectations as well as risks of fiscal slippages a the centre and state government levels.

Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director of RBI, while voting for the status quo on the policy repo rate favoured maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening.

""With inflation projected to rise above 4 percent over the 12-month ahead horizon, it is apposite to persevere with the stance of calibrated tightening to head off inflation pressures from potentially corroding the foundations of the growth path that is evolving over the medium-term,"" Patra said during the three-day MPC policy review.

Former Indian Institute of Management professor Ravindra H Dholakia said the best that can be done under the present circumstances is to hold the rate but change the stance to neutral to take care of all possible uncertainties.

""We should not deny any possibility of either a rate cut or a rate hike in the near future depending on data coming in,"" he said.

The sole female member in the six-member panel Delhi School of Economics Director Pami Dua also expressed her views that even as inflation has softened, the upside risks remain.

It is therefore best to pause and wait for incoming data while maintaining a vigil on inflation, especially with respect to food and crude oil, Dua said.

""At the same time, given the uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook, I also vote for maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening,"" she added to her observation.

Member Chetan Ghate, professor, Indian Statistical Institute viewed ""both the inflation and growth numbers having developed 'soft-spots', the appropriate risk-management approach at the current juncture would be to 'wait and watch'.

This will allow the MPC to see how various risks to both inflation and growth evolve, and better assess the ability of flexible inflation targeting to absorb the impact of shocks that the economy is currently experiencing, said the Minutes of MPC quoting Ghate.

Consumer price index (CPI) based retail inflation had eased to a 17-month low of 2.33 percent for November due to softer food prices, the government data showed earlier this month.

In October, it was at a year low of 3.38 percent.

While there's a lot resting on the Fed move and whatever Fed Chair Jerome Powell says afterward at his press conference, at the end of the day, no matter what he does, the ping pong of tariffs doesn't go away. The overlying theme is still tariffs. Companies are still trying to figure out what the rules of the game might be, and that's affecting their desire and ability to spend.

With December off to the month's worst start in 38 years, there seems to be more hanging on this gathering than any other recently. Some economists have urged the Fed to delay another hike, but arguably that might make things even worse for the markets. People could interpret that as a sign of the Fed being increasingly worried about the economy.

Futures trading puts chances of a hike at 71% as of early Tuesday, which might indicate a likely raise perhaps accompanied by dovish ""wait and see"" language about 2019. One school of thought is that with all the pressure on the Fed, this might be the last hike for a while.

Until the Fed decision, investors could see slow trading. That's often the case when a Fed decision looms. There's a more positive tone early Tuesday after Monday's sell-off, but it's hard to feel too much optimism with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 1,000 points over the last two sessions alone and the S&P 500 index sitting just above its low for the year (set yesterday). We've seen this movie before. Every recent rally attempt has fizzled out, bringing major indices back down to flat or even lower by the end of the session. It might be a moral victory to see this early buying simply hold up.

As the Fed meeting loomed, some positive data came out early Tuesday from the housing market. November housing starts and building permits both hit it out of the park, easily exceeding Wall Street analysts' expectations. The market, however, didn't seem to get any immediate boost from the numbers.

A sell-off that rolled into the weekend picked up pace Monday, taking all the major U.S. indices to 2% losses for the second-straight session and setting a new 2018 closing low for the S&P 500. The storyline didn't change much from Friday, with investors still apparently squeamish about slowing overseas economic prospects and chances of a rate hike from the Fed later this week.

Though the SPX remains a long way from entering an official bear market (down 20% from the high), it is down 13% from the year's closing peak, and all of the FAANG stocks that helped drive momentum earlier this year are in bear territory. Also, the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RUT) is now officially in a bear market. Barron's observed over the weekend that many small companies are burdened with issues like high valuations, slowing revenues, margin pressure, or excess leverage.

If you like slasher movies, this might be the market for you, with bleeding in every sector. Even so-called ""defensive"" neighborhoods like utilities took a dive on Monday. There's also a mess in the commodity pits, where crude crumbled to close below $50 a barrel for the first time in over a year. Another industrial commodity, copper, fell too. By early Tuesday, U.S. crude prices were well under $49, burdened by heavy supplies and booming production pretty much anywhere you look around the world.

Meanwhile, volatility spiked close to 15% as measured by the VIX, which rose back toward levels near 25 seen during the October sell-off.

Recent dollar strength hasn't been a very welcome Christmas gift for some of the major U.S. multinationals, including those bellwethers of trade with China, namely Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Both have been hit pretty hard over the last month or so, but then again, who hasn't? Anyway, some positive news from BA came out late Monday when the company said it planned to raise its dividend 20% and increase stock buybacks. It cited strength in its business and confidence in its outlook, and shares rose in post-market trading. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also announced a $5 billion buyback. It might be worth watching to see if some other deep-pocketed companies try similar strategies here in the depths of this sell-off, perhaps trying to pull investors back in even as their stocks come under pressure.

Another positive for any company would be solid earnings, and that's what Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) appeared to deliver after the close Monday, beating Wall Street analysts' top- and bottom-line expectations. Shares rose around 4% in post-market trading, but ORCL remains down for the year. The company continues to transition into the cloud business, seeing year-over-year revenue fall slightly during the quarter, so it's not necessarily out of the woods.

As ugly as things have gotten, the selling still seems orderly. What does that mean? It means there's no sign of a real panic, which would be the case if we saw aggressive selling of stocks and buying of risk-off products like bonds, gold, and the VIX. This hasn't been a true ""dump"" of stocks, and there hasn't been a major spike in volatility.

What might be happening is that many investors who bought the dip the first time the market went down back in October didn't benefit, and now they're apparently not so willing to buy the next dip. It looks like many investors are willing to own stocks for now, but the question is whether at some point they start to throw up their hands and panic. So to sum up, it's not like everyone is rushing for the exits, but there's just not a lot of desire to buy, partly because of the tariff overhang. Think about how orderly this downturn has been. It probably reflects a lack of buyers, not panic selling.

Also, there's some technical stuff to consider keeping in mind. The SPX managed to close just a touch under the psychological 2600 mark last week, but then fell through technical support below that at 2570 by late Monday. That set up a test of 2530, just under the intraday low for the year of 2532 posted back in February.

By late Monday, the SPX had fallen below 2532 to set a new low for the year before swinging up slightly to end the day. Some analysts say there might be a gap in support below 2530 that extends down to near the 2400 level, which is a long way to fall. Such a drop would put the SPX within a couple of percentage points of falling into bear territory for the first time since the 2008-09 economic crisis. That means 2530 could remain the level to watch when trading starts Tuesday.

With the SPX down more than 5% for the year and facing a possible annual loss for the first time since 2015, the question might be whether the market is baking in too negative a forward outlook. Here's why. In 2015, as the SPX fell just under 1% for the full year, earnings were also on the decline.

In what analysts then called an ""earnings recession,"" quarterly S&P 500 earnings fell the final three quarters of 2015, with a worse than 3% year-over-year performance in Q4. Things are a lot different now. The market is falling, but earnings have been impressive all year. They've risen more than 20% the last two quarters, and many analysts still expect mid-teens growth for Q4. Looking into 2019, the picture weakens, but it's still not an earnings ""recession"" if current estimates of mid-to-high single-digit earnings growth don't fall.

However, as an analyst on CNBC noted Monday, the SPX is behaving now as if there's not going to be any earnings growth at all next year. The forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio now stands at about 15, according to Factset, barely above the 10-year average (which includes the depths of the 2008-09 economic crisis), and down from 18 or higher earlier this year. So either the market is right and earnings next year have farther to fall, or the market is aiming too low, meaning you could argue the SPX is underpriced at current levels. This is a debate that's not going to be decided anytime soon, but could make for interesting viewing as the new year rolls in.

From a U.S. data perspective, things continue to look pretty good, though Monday's Empire Manufacturing number for December came in well under expectations. Some of the interest rate-sensitive sectors like cars and housing continue to come under pressure, but wages and job growth still look strong even while inflation remains manageable. The only thing is, jobs and wages are sometimes seen by economists as trailing indicators, meaning they can be the last statistics to go up in a rising economy.

There are a couple of things particularly relevant to this week that investors might want to keep in mind. First, there's earnings from a bunch of companies, including Oracle, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Nike (NYSE:NKE). There's also quadruple witching on Friday, marking the simultaneous expiry of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options & single stock futures. This can result in volatility as traders unwind positions.

Also, many hedge funds and traders are measured this week in terms of bonuses, so they may be unloading any positions they have that are still up for the year.

Figure 1: Technical Points to Ponder. The breakout to the downside has many chart watchers eyeing possible levels of technical support. Today's low in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) of 2530 eclipsed the February low of 2532, but a bit of end-of-day support kept the SPX from a settlement at a new low. Looking beyond that level to the downside, some point to the night of the 2016 election, when a head-fake break down to 2083 turned to breakout rally that seemed to be a one-way train until it derailed in February 2018.

Thank Goodness It's (Not) Friday? Lately, Fridays just haven't been kind to bullish investors. The S&P 500 fell on three of the last four Friday sessions, with steep losses on the last two, especially. One school of thought suggests investors are nervous about what sorts of developments might happen over the weekend, so they could be taking profit ahead of time. This is sometimes the kind of thing you see in volatile markets like this where geopolitical issues are swirling and headlines frequently drive price movements. People are afraid of the next shoe to possibly drop.

GAAP Gap? Speaking of earnings and P/E ratios, one thing to consider keeping an eye out for in Q4 earnings is any widening of GAAP and adjusted results in company reports. As a reminder, GAAP stands for ""Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,"" but tends to get overlooked in media and sell-side analyst reports, where adjusted earnings pull in most of the headlines. Adjusted earnings are simply that -- ""adjusted"" to leave out any issue the company considers relevant to only the quarter in question. Those factors get covered by the GAAP earnings, meaning adjusted is sometimes considered the best way to track a company's long-term performance unencumbered by one-time costs like an expense associated with closing a factory or paying for a product recall.

Still, when times get tough, companies have been known to stretch the definition of ""one time,"" so they can ensure that adjusted earnings meet or exceed Wall Street analysts' projections. This doesn't mean they're breaking any laws, only that adjusted earnings might tell a brighter story than GAAP earnings do. When the ""gap"" between GAAP and adjusted widens, then it might be time for investors to wonder if companies are starting to use fancy accounting to make up for any problems and still meet their own or Wall Street's projections on the adjusted line. If that seems like the case, it might be worth taking a closer look at the individual company's performance to see if issues deeper down in its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings reflect any issues for concern. Though it may seem daunting, if you really have a large position in a company's stock, it's probably a good idea to read through the key parts of its most recent 10-K filing and be aware of the company's major challenges (outlined in that filing). Then you can think of how that might eventually spill over into the bottom line and potentially affect the company's P/E.

Pressure on Fed Mounts: As the Fed gathers today, it's coming under increased pressure to adopt a more dovish strategy. An op-ed Monday in The Wall Street Journal co-written by Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed's Board of Governors, warned the Fed to take note of slowing overseas economic growth, softening credit markets, and falling commodity prices. It was titled, ""Fed Tightening? Not Now."""

Every year, the IPL auction throws up a bumper pay-day for at least a handful of Indian domestic cricketers, relatively unknown to the world.

This year, the names Varun Chakravarthy and Shivam Dube get added to that list.

The two unheralded players saw their humble base price of Rs 20 lakh sky-rocket into orbit at the IPL 2019 Auction in Jaipur on Tuesday, 18 December.

Here's all you need to know about the two newest rags-to-riches stories from the IPL's stables.

Varun Chakravarthy

A story to amuse, and inspire.

An avid player during his school days, Varun decided to leave the game and take up a regular job. But the passion for the sport could only be suppressed for so long, and at the age of 25, he decided to foray back into the game.

Two years later, he is a proud recipient of a Rs 8.40 crore pay-cheque at the IPL 2019 Auction - the figure Kings XI Punjab deemed fit for the mystery spinner hailing from Karaikudi Kaalai in Tamil Nadu.

Chakravarthy possesses some seven variations in his bowling armour, one he utilised with aplomb at both the top and the death in the 2018 edition of the Tamil Nadu Premier League.

The 27-year-old's economy rate at the TNPL was a superb 4.7; he went better in the group stage of the Vijay Hazare Trophy, conceding only 4.23 runs an over while being the leading wicket-taker with 22 wickets in nine matches.

Shivam Dube

Shivam Dube made headlines after he clobbered veteran leggie Pravin Tambe for five sixes in an over during the eliminator of the Mumbai T20 league earlier this year. After setting a base price of INR 20 lakhs for himself, Dube failed to crack the auction ahead of IPL 2018 in January. Months later, his fortunes have flipped.

Dube was snared by Royal Challengers Bangalore for Rs 5 crore - a whopping 2500% value hike on his Rs 20 lakh base price.

The 25-year-old all-rounder made his T20 debut for Mumbai during the 2015-16 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. In 13 T20s that he has played so far, the southpaw has scored at a strike rate of almost 150 and has also picked up 10 scalps.

His heroics have even impressed former cricketers, with Sunil Gavaskar going as far as comparing the explosive batsman to the likes of Saurav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh.

A decent U.S. retail sales data number didn't initially appear to be enough to offset the sluggishness abroad.

China's retail sales data growth came in below expectations and was the weakest in five years, while industrial output there grew the slowest in three years, possibly a sign of the trade war coming home to roost. Private sector business activity in Europe also fell, news that came just one day after the European Central Bank (ECB) sliced its growth and inflation forecasts.

The sluggish numbers appeared to affect overseas market performance early Friday as Chinese stocks fell more than 1.5% and Japan's fell 2%. Closer to home, in Europe, all the major indices were off more than 0.5%.

U.S. markets weren't immune to the pressure from abroad, with the major indices losing ground before the opening bell despite November U.S. retail sales growth of 0.2% that matched Wall Street analysts' expectations.

November Retail Sales Another Sign of Healthy U.S. Consumer

Slicing the U.S. data a bit further, retail sales look even better, up 0.5% if you strip out declining gasoline prices. Also, the government raised its October retail sales estimate to 1.1%, from 0.9%. Auto sales rose slightly in November. In a nutshell, this is what we've been seeing for a while: U.S. numbers continuing to show consumer demand while foreign economies lag. U.S. consumers still seem pretty healthy, but the December retail sales data might tell a more important story, because it's arguable that fears of a slowdown didn't really start to hit until mid-November.

As Chinese and European data disappointed and markets slid, investors seem to be gravitating toward more of the so-called ""risk-off"" kind of assets early Friday. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell back below 2.9% and the dollar index climbed above 97.5, not far from its 97.69 high for the year. So it looks like today might be another struggle, at least from early signs. Investors are still likely to be watching for any additional China trade news after signs earlier this week of a slight thaw as China made some concessions.

Still, it looks now like many investors are seeking shelter from the storm as the weekend approaches. Technical support for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) near the November closing lows of around 2630 might get breached pretty quickly, the way things look, and support below that might be found near the psychological 2600 level.

The Chinese and European data came after a mixed set of tidings from the earnings front late Thursday. Shares of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell in pre-market trading after the tech company beat Wall Street's revenue expectations but missed by a penny on earnings per share. One positive takeaway besides the revenue beat is that ADBE's revenue outlook for fiscal Q1 and for the full year surpassed analysts' estimates. Revenue growth looked strong worldwide in fiscal Q4.

At the same time, investors took shares of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) lower in pre-market trading after an earnings report that came up a bit shy of expectations. The big-box retailer continues to face lots of online competition, and shares of the company have flattened slightly after a strong start to 2018.

Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is another company providing insight on the U.S. consumer. Retail sales today, which continued to look robust, contrast with the weak housing market. It looks like for the most part consumers are pretty comfortable spending money on shorter-term items, but not so much ""long-term"" money on big purchases like homes.

Financials Still on the Fritz

Earlier this week, it looked like financials might help lift the market out of its funk. That was before the sector took another downward ride on Thursday.

Though financials did inch back from intraday lows and finished down about 0.6% for the session regional banks once again took it on the chin. That could account for part of the pressure on the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small-cap stocks, which fell more than 1.5%, the worst of any major index Thursday. The RUT finished the day close to bear market territory, down nearly 18% from the late-August closing high. A 20% drop would place it into a bear market.

Getting back to financials, it's a bit concerning how badly the banks are getting pounded this week, and it's also kind of a head-scratcher. Though yields on Treasury notes are down sharply from their fall highs, Thursday's finish at about 2.91% for the 10-year yield is almost 10 basis points above last week's lows. Bonds saw some selling pressure Thursday after the European Central Bank (ECB) announced that its bond buying program would end this month. That means the ECB's debt purchases will fall from 15 billion euros per month to zero.

Normally, rising yields and the end of a quantitative easing program would tend to give banks a lift.

Still, U.S. financials -- including multinational firms with exposure to Europe -- are having a tough time. One school of thought suggests that the weakness might be a canary in a coal mine hinting that some investors sense 2019 earnings could turn out worse than expected. Though most analysts see overall earnings growth slowing quite a bit next year from sizzling gains of 20% or more in mid-to-late 2018, there's still widespread hope for at least mid-single digit S&P 500 earnings growth. Only time will tell if the financials are hinting at some kind of shock to the downside.

Whatever the case with earnings, financials have arguably been an anchor on Wall Street's boat for months. It was no different Thursday, though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) and the Nasdaq (COMP) managed to close with light gains.

Tug-of-War on Risk

The ""risk-off"" sentiment appeared to be back Thursday to some extent, with utilities, staples, and real estate among the sector leaders. However, there were signs of some optimism, too, especially when you consider the fixed income market weakness and gains in info tech and energy. Crude had a great day Thursday. If crude can keep rallying, and that's a big ""if"" considering the supply situation, perhaps that might help investors feel more bullish about the economy both in the U.S. and overseas.

Despite the market's inability to maintain early rallies over the last few days, there are some signs that things could be headed in the right direction, including positive sentiment around trade with China after a couple of developments earlier this week, and an analyst upgrade to General Electric (NYSE:GE) (see more below). Also, volatility as measured by the VIX slipped to just above 20, and the S&P 500 (SPX) hasn't shown signs of any major test of recent lows down below 2600. However, there's likely going to be a lot of volatility until we get some resolution on tariffs.

There's also the possibility of a partial U.S. government shutdown at the end of next week. Historically, shutdowns have had mixed impacts on the market, with stocks rising during about half of them. Even if there is a shutdown, it's unlikely to have a big effect. Right now, the market appears to care most about the outcome of the US-China trade negotiations, and all other news could be secondary. Though the implications of a potential government shutdown may weigh on the minds of some investors, arguably the most pressing issue is whether we can get any clarity on the direction of the tariff talks.

The other things to consider keeping in mind as next week approaches are some critical housing data along with ""quadruple witching"" a week from today that might see traders cleaning up some of their positions ahead of time. Remember, quadruple witching is the simultaneous expiry of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options & single stock futures.

Figure 1: Regional Banks Hit Hard: Over the last three months, regional banks (candlestick) are down nearly 20%, while the S&P 500 Financial sector (purple line), which had been doing a bit better than regionals last month, has recently joined them in the doldrums. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Pressing the Upgrade Button: Though JP Morgan's (JPM) upgrade of battered General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) shares to neutral drew a slew of headlines Thursday and helped send the stock to early double-digit gains, GE wasn't the only big-name stock to receive positive analyst views in recent days. Others included AT&T (NYSE:T) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), both of which are down sharply from their yearly highs. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), another stock that's had its ups and downs this year, also saw some analysts raising price targets recently. The GE and AAPL upgrades might simply reflect some analysts looking at the price action and determining there's not much further to fall after dramatic losses.

On the other hand, those making upgrades and raising price targets also saw some fundamental things to like, citing improved cash flows at GE and TSLA. While that's not necessarily the most thrilling kind of news, it might provide a counter to the negative talk that's cast a cloud over the market lately. We'll see if any more analyst upgrades come out of the woodwork in coming days with stocks still near their yearly lows. Additional upgrades of major companies might help add to the sense that the market could be carving some sort of a bottom.

Fed Surprise? Unlikely: Back in June 2016, the Fed seemed primed to raise rates. The economy was recovering from weakness earlier that year, and Fed funds futures indicated a likely hike. Then the Fed threw a surprise curveball, electing not to raise rates that month due to a poor May jobs report. As we approach next week's Fed meeting, some economists wonder if the Fed might pull punches again, even though the futures market continues to point to a very solid 80% chance for a hike. It's probably best to expect exactly that, though of course there's no guarantee. As former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder told CNBC yesterday, the current Fed funds target range of 2% to 2.25% means monetary policy still has its foot on the accelerator despite full employment and economic growth of around 3%. Historically, the Fed hasn't eased policy in this kind of economy. While it may not be time for the Fed to slam the brakes yet, shifting into neutral seems a likely option. Some say 2.5% has historically marked the bottom of a ""neutral"" range that neither sparks the economy nor wears it down, and it wouldn't be surprising to see rates reach that level sometime next year barring any shocks to the economy.

Brexit Act XX: The Shakespearean drama that never seems to end in Europe was back in the spotlight this week as British Prime Minister Theresa May postponed a parliamentary vote on Brexit and survived a challenge to her leadership. She then traveled to Brussels to meet with other European leaders, but May said she doesn't expect an immediate breakthrough. She also still faces a Parliament that seems unwilling to approve her compromise deal. That means the market could find itself back where it started before this rocky week, facing the prospect of a ""no-deal"" Brexit if something can't be done before the late-March deadline. As this approaches, it could make anyone holding European stocks nervous and weigh on the euro. The euro now trades at $1.13, near the low end of its six-month range. The dollar index remains near its 2018 highs above 97. Lately, a vigorous dollar has been one factor arguably weighing on U.S. stocks. Lack of a Brexit dénouement could keep dollar strength at center stage, possibly to the chagrin of the investor audience."

For all the petrolheads out there, last week was a pretty exciting one. Not only did we get more details on what to expect from the upcoming Nissan Kicks SUV, we also got some dope on a seven-seater Harrier in the works. That aside, it was all about spy shots and we got the first glimpses of the most hotly anticipated cars coming in the next two years such as the 2019 Toyota Camry and the second gen Mahindra Thar. South Korean carmaker Kia also revealed its India plans in detail and said it will launch 5 cars by 2022 here.

Being the end of the year there were very few launches last week, Land Rover introduced the 2019 Discovery Sport for India and the Tata Tiago got a snazzier XZ+ trim. Globally though, Porsche's new Macan S got an amped up version for 2019 and McLaren revealed the bonkers and beautiful 720S Spider.

Here's a complete lowdown of all the headlines from last week.

Nissan Kicks Vs Creta Vs S-Cross Vs Captur Specs Compared

It is well known that Japanese carmaker Nissan is trying to reposition itself in India as a premium mainstream brand, and hopes to do so by introducing its global lineup of cars in the country. The upcoming Kicks is the first piece in this puzzle and Nissan is betting big on it to spearhead an all new range of cars under its revamped strategy for India.

Expected to be priced between Rs 10 lakh to Rs 14 lakh (ex-showroom), the Kicks will compete with the best-selling Hyundai Creta, the Renault Captur and the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross. With Nissan revealing the specifications of the Kicks, let us see if it has what it takes to go head on with its major rivals, on paper.

Tata Harrier Seven-Seater In The Works, Launch In 2020

After the much hype and speculation, Tata Motors has confirmed to us that a seven-seat version of the Harrier is under development. The homegrown manufacturer has also confirmed that it will first showcase a concept, dubbed H7X, that will preview the SUV.

We're expecting the concept to debut at the Geneva Motor Show, considering how Tata has always showcased their showstoppers at the annual Swiss auto show. Check out all the details on the seven seater Harrier here.

Beefier Next-gen Mahindra Thar Caught Testing

The brawny, old-school Mahindra Thar is all set to get bigger and beefier. The next generation Thar, which was confirmed to be under development by Mahindra themselves, has been spotted testing for the first time in India. And by the looks of the test mule, it seems to be both longer and wider than the current-gen model. Likely to be underpinned by an all new platform and featuring an all new BS VI compliant turbo diesel engine, the new Thar could be launched at the 2020 Auto Expo. Check out all the spy shots here.

2019 Toyota Camry Spied Testing In India

The next-gen, all-new Toyota Camry has been spied testing a few days after the previous-gen car was discontinued. The eighth-generation Camry is based on the company's new GA-K platform which also underpins the Lexus ES 300 h. The new Camry is 29mm longer, 14mm wider, has a 49mm longer wheelbase. However, it is 35mm lower than the outgoing model.Likely to be powered by a hybrid powertrain which includes a 2.5-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine paired to an electric motor driving the front wheels, the new Camry could be launched as early as January 2019. Here are all the details about the 2019 Camry.

Tata 45X-based Hatchback Spied Again, Interiors Revealed

Tata's all new Baleno rival, the 45X is shaping up to be quite a good looking premium hatchback. In the latest round of spy shots, the car can be seen sporting a more practical design than the early concept previewed at the Auto Expo. The connected taillamps merging into the rising shoulder line, the larger three-dimensional grille, and the sleek headlamps flanking the grille have the Tata design team's stamp all over it.

We should see the production-spec version hit showrooms before Diwali 2019. And to hit rivals where it hurts the most, expect a competitive price tag too, which is likely to begin at Rs 5 lakh and top out at Rs 8.5 lakh (ex-showroom). Click to see more details revealed in spy pictures.

Kia Bets Big On India, To Launch 5 Cars By 2022

South Korean carmaker Kia is planning to enter the Indian market next year with the SP Concept-based SUV showcased at the 2018 Auto Expo. While the premium SUV in the compact segment is Kia's first, it will mark the beginning of a long lineup of India-specific cars that will follow suit.

Kia has confirmed that it plans to have at least five made-in-India cars in its lineup by 2022. It intends to launch a new car every six months, starting with the SP Concept-based SUV in September 2019. A multi-pronged product strategy will help Kia foray into booming segments like the sub-4m SUV, premium hatchback and premium MPV.

Kia plans to be among the top five carmakers in India by 2022 with a market share of 10-15 per cent by the time it reaches 100 per cent capacity utilisation. Tap here to read all about Kia's India plans and upcoming lie of cars.

Land Rover Launches 2019 Discovery Sport

Jaguar Land Rover has launched the 2019 Discovery Sport SUV in the country. Prices for the SUV remain unchanged and start at Rs 44.68 lakh and it can be had with 2.0-litre Ingenium petrol and diesel engines. Notably, the 2.0-litre diesel motor on the SE and HSE variants get a more powerful state of tune. It now produces 179PS of power when compared to the Pure variant's 149PS. Here's what all has changed in the 2019 model.

Tiago Gets New XZ+ Top trim With More Features

The Tata Tiago XZ+ has been added to the range as the new flagship variant of Tata's popular hatchback. The changes are comprehensive enough to catch people's attention, and the price hike is small enough to make them consider buying it.

The XZ+ variant costs Rs 26,000-Rs 42,000 over the XZ, depending on the engine chosen and an all new 7-inch touchscreen infotainment unit from the Tigor. Check out all the features and detailed pricing here.

Hyundai Considering Palisade Launch For India?

It has been well known that Hyundai has promised to bring six all-new SUVs over the next couple of years in India. We know for a fact that Hyundai is working towards bringing its first sub-4 metre SUV based on the Carlino concept by April 2019. We'll also meet Hyundai India's first EV in the form of the Kona EV next year,. Then, there's the next-generation Creta as well that should hit showrooms by early 2020. Hyundai is considering the new Santa Fe to take on the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq, while an SUV slotted below the Carlino (think Kwid) is on the cards as well. The sixth SUV in this list, we reckon, could be the Palisade.

If market conditions prove conducive, we can see Hyundai India venturing into a space they've never been in before with the Palisade, and the carmaker will go up against entry-level luxury SUVs such as the Volvo XC40, BMW X1, Audi Q3 and the Mercedes-Benz GLA. Unveiled at the LA Motor Show last month, here are all the details about the big seven seater SUV from Hyundai.

New McLaren 720S Spider Unveiled

Christmas seems to have come early this year as the British marque McLaren has taken the wraps off its drop dead gorgeous convertible, the 720S Spider. Based on the 720S Coupe, the new Mclaren is meant to combine the thrill of open-air driving with great handling and performance. McLaren's all new Ferrari 488 Spider rival is leaner, meaner and lighter and is by a 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged McLaren V8 engine which produces 720PS and 770Nm of torque. Talking of numbers, this convertible is capable of doing a 0-100kmph run in just 2.9 seconds and costs just over Rs 2.15 crore in the UK. Here are all the details of this piece of art from the British marque.

2019 Porsche Macan S Revealed; Gets a New V6 Turbo Engine

Porsche has added a new model to the Macan range with the reveal of the new Macan S. Aside form refreshed looks, the Macan S also brings with it a new 3.0-litre turbocharged V6 engine. It produces 354PS of max power and 480Nm of peak torque. Although Porsche hasn't specified the transmission of the new Macan S, we expect it to be the company's revered 7-speed PDK transmission. The Macan facelift is yet to be launched in India. We expect it to make its debut here in the first quarter of next year. Meanwhile you can read all about it here.
