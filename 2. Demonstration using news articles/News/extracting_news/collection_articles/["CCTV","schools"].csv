From adding more buses to cracking down on factories and by incentivising zero-emission vehicles to reducing the load on existing landfill sites -- this year will see a host of projects that will hope to transform the city's carbon footprint, offer faster and greener mobility, and cleaner living spaces.

Following is the list of changes that Delhiites can look forward to in 2019:

The government is set to induct 3,000 buses to the city's fleet. While 1,000 of these will be AC low-floor buses, 1,000 will be standard-floor buses with hydraulic lifts. Buses will be added to the city's fleet after nearly 10 years. Against need of 11,000 buses, the city only has 5,460 buses.

1,000 AC low-floor electric buses will be inducted along with charging infrastructure at depots at East Vinod Nagar, Bawana Sector 5, Burari, Rohini Sector 37, Revla Khanpur and Narela.

The 'Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Rules, 2017', will lay uniform rules for parking which will disallow free parking in residential areas as well public spaces. Parking rates will also be linked to pollution levels. It will be the first attempt to organise parking in Delhi.

Who it will help: It will help to decongest the city

When it is scheduled: Despite clearances early last year, the policy has seen no movement

4) Electric Vehicle Policy

Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy, 2018, tries to kick start EV adoption. It targets 25% of all vehicle registrations to be electric by 2023. The policy primarily focuses on electrifying the two-wheeler segment.

Who it will help: It will help bring in a new generation of zero-emission vehicles

The flyover will start from near the Munirka petrol pump on Outer Ring Road and end before NH-8, close to the Army Hospital. It will be 2.7km long and is expected to ease traffic movement from south Delhi and Noida, towards the airport and Gurugram

In March, the government conceptualised a project to beautify roads wider than 60 ft and managed by the PWD. The beautified roads will be wider, greener, clean and pedestrian and cycle friendly. The project is in planning stage and tenders are to be awarded.

Who it will help: It will make roads pedestrian friendly and will also help in reducing dust pollution

Around 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras will be installed on PWD roads, gates of residential colonies, markets, parks, parking bays, community spaces/halls. It will ensure safety of citizens.

Under its project to construct 12,748 rooms in Delhi government schools, the government said it will make 9,981 classrooms. Of these, around 5,000 classrooms are already constructed, while remaining will be made in 2019. The rooms will help schools to accommodate more students.

9) Entrepreneurship Classes

The government will start 'entrepreneurship curriculum' from Classes 9 to 12 to encourage students to become 'job givers' and not 'job seekers'.

Delhi is looking at a series of initiatives this year including implementing long term measures listed under the Comprehensive Action Plan. It comprises plans that include testing 'cloud seeding' to trigger artificial rain and introduction of green crackers during Diwali. If implemented in its totality, the CAP could bring down pollution by nearly 70%.

Who will it help: All Delhi-NCR residents

Schedule: While it has been notified, the application of some measures remains pending

An independent cyber cell will be set up that works under the anti-terror unit. It will focus on solving the increasing cases of cyber fraud. Currently the Delhi Police's cyber cell and Economic Offences Wing work together.

Who will it help: City residents who are victims of hacking, ransomware and other forms of cyber attacks

More than 250 new mohalla clinics will come up across the city as part of the AAP government's plan to have 1,000 such clinics. There will be at least one such clinic in every 5km once all the clinics come up.

The government is likely to introduce the Delhi Health Bill to regulate all medical establishments including diagnostics lab, IVF clinic, dental clinics, and blood banks. Under the bill, a council will be formed to regulate Delhi's medical establishments.

Who will it help: Delhi residents and people from other states who come to the city for treatment

When it is scheduled: The bill is likely to be introduced in the cabinet next month

14) Bike Ambulances

As part of a pilot project, 16 motorcycle ambulances with first responders on board will provide pre-hospitalisation care to patients in congested areas of east Delhi. The paramedics will be equipped to control bleeding, immobilise patients with skull or spine fracture, perform CPR, manage the airway, and provide oxygen.

Segregation of waste in homes will be the key focus area for the municipal corporations. The SDMC has already started this practice at certain colonies while the North MCD also aims to start the project this year. Segregation of waste at household and at the level of bulk generators will help in controlling the garbage mess across the city.

Who will it help: Better management of waste is beneficial for the environment

When it is scheduled: Already operational in some colonies, it will be expanded in 2019

16) Reviving Lakes

As NITI Aayog warned the city could run out of groundwater by 2020, the government said it plans to revive at least 159 water bodies and create at least five new lakes. The rejuvenation of water bodies and creation of new lakes is expected to raise the ground water table.

What will it cost: .Rs 500 crore

When it is scheduled: Proposal for lakes in Rohini, Nilothi, Dwarka and Najafgarh approved. Approval for Timarpur Lake soon

The Delhi government, in its budget, allocated funds for free Wi-fi across Delhi. After much procedural delay, it was decided that the internet will be provided on the 'hotspot' model where hundreds of zones will be created in market areas, parks, major intersections and some residential areas. The Wi-fi will be available within a 100 metre radius from the source of the hotspot and around 200 people will be able to use it at one time. The project, estimated to cost Rs 566 crore, will mostly be beneficial for youngsters, office goers and tourists.

How it will change city: Though most people access internet through their mobile data packs which now have become cheaper, the service will boost tourism in Delhi. It would also help in emergency situations apart from ensuring better governance.

The government plans to introduce Phase-1 of its ambitious 'Intelligent Traffic Management System'. Under the system, one-third of the city's traffic will be managed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). There will be fewer traffic policemen and depth sensors with cameras through AI will regulate traffic signals. The sensors will predict traffic, possible choke points and guide users through smart signals on the roads. With less than 6,000 traffic police officers to manage more than 1 crore vehicular traffic in Delhi, the ITM system, which will cost Rs1,000 crore, can help prevent traffic congestion. Traffic police are in process of purchasing high-resolution cameras with sensor based real time traffic volume count technology. Currently, traffic police on the roads rely on their experience to divert or stop certain routes in peak hours."

The first trainset has been rolled out by ICF in October 2018 and will shortly be ready for service after testing & trials.ICF shall be making at least two more such rakes this year. Depending on feedback, requirements target for induction in 2019-20 shall be communicated in due course.

Bogibeel bridge: Commissioning of Bogibeel Bridge, is among the mega projects completed by Railways this year.It is longest Rail-cum-Road Bridge of India (4.94 Km long Bridge) across Brahmaputra river near Dibrugarh in Assam, dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25.

Double line track with three-lane road and 74 km of total railway track, this Project was sanctioned in 1997-98 at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore and the work was commenced in April, 2002 by Bharat Ratna late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister. The completion cost of the project is Rs 5,820 crore (approx).

Safety first: Safety continues to be the foremost priority of Railways and is accorded the greatest consideration. During the current year, Ministry of Railways launched following four safety drives on all Zonal Railways with a view to preventing accidents and strengthening safety in trains.

As a result of relentless efforts put in by Railways, consequential train accidents decreased from 104 to 73 during 2017-18 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year. In the year 2018-19 (from April 1 to November 30) consequential train accidents decreased further from 51 to 44 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year.

On April 13 all zonal railways were advised to launch a one month safety drive particularly focusing on strict observance of shunting practices with compliance of rules/instructions contained in G&SR. On October 16, zonal Railways were advised to launch a special safety drive for a period of fifteen days with special emphasis on safety of work sites, stacking and handling of railway material near track and maintenance of points & crossings.

Smart coach with diagnostic system monitor bearing vibrations provides advance information on health of bearing wheel & track. In addition, coach has been provided with wheel slip protection monitoring.

Further improvements are being brought about to provide fire safety through fire and smoke detection unit integrated with passenger announcement and information system for emergency evacuation and video analytics with phased detection and unusual occurrence features to further enhance safety and security.

Railways did a great work by eliminating of level crossings as 3,478 unmanned LC gates have been eliminated during the current year so far. In effect, all unmanned level crossings on broad gauge over Indian Railway have been eliminated except one. This will also be eliminated in the current financial year.

Out of 16, total 15 Zonal Railways are now unmanned level crossing free on broad gauge, accidents on unmanned level crossings have reduced from 20 in 2017-18 to 3 in the current year up to December 2018.

Act East: DEMU services were introduced in Tinsukia Division of NF Railway in 2016-17. New coaching depots have become functional at Silchar in Barak valley region of Assam and at Agartala in Tripura. These measures have provided better connectivity to the isolated region of North East. The following projects have also been sanctioned for the North East region.

Railways saw a vast level of development in North East Region like 970 km Gauge Conversion completed in NE region in last four years. Thus, all MG sections converted to BG and there is no MG operation in entire North East Region. 353.15 km of New Line/Gauge Conversion/Doubling commissioned per year during the period 2014-15 to 2017-18 as against on average of 110 km commissioning per year in NE Region in period from 2009 to 2014.

Fifteen new lines projects of 1,397 km length having a total cost of Rs 47,695 crore are in different stages of planning, sanction, execution which fall partly or fully in the NE states. Six doubling projects of 482 km length having a total cost of Rs 9,305 crore are in different stages of Planning/Sanction/Execution which fall partly orfully in the states of NE region.

Railways has also enhanced the connectivity to North Eastern states. The Seven Sister States of North Eastern India (Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh) have been connected by Rail network. Meghalaya came on the rail map with the flagging off the first ever train from Guwahati to Mendipathar in Meghalaya on November 29, 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Tripura has been put on broad gauge railway map. On July 31, 2016, the then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu flagged off the Agartala-New Delhi 'Tripura Sundari Express'. The Agartala-New Delhi Rajdhani Express was launched on October 28, 2017. It trudges the longest route (2,422 km) for any Rajdhani Express in service.

Jiribam, the first railway station in Manipur was connected by broad gauge line. The Prime Minister flagged off the first passenger train service to Jiribam on May 27, 2016. The passenger train service to Bhairabi in Mizoram was also flagged off by him. Lumding - Silchar Broad Gauge section inaugurated after Gauge Conversion on November 20, 2015, giving seamless BG connectivity to Barak Valley of Assam.

Manufacturing: Railways have decided to completely switch over to manufacture of LHB design main line coaches from 2018-19 onwards. The production of LHB coaches in Production Units has continuously increased over the years Production of LHB coaches from 2004-05 to 2013-14 was 2, 327 coaches, whereas 5,548 coaches were produced from 2014-15 to 2017-18. During 2018-19, it is proposed to manufacture 4,016 coaches.

There has been highest ever sanction of track machines as the average sanction of machines per year for complete mechanization has been increased to 117 costing about Rs1,547 crore during 2014-18 compared to 63 costing about Rs 560 crore prior to 2014. Highest ever 538 machines costing Rs 7,268 crore were sanctioned in the current year Budget to give fillip to mechanisation.

Hundred per cent indigensation has already been achieved in manufacturing of around 20-25 per cent of total fleet of the track machines such as Utility Vehicles (UTVs), Rail Bound Maintenance Vehicles (RBMVs), Track Laying Equipment (TLE), Rail Threader & Rail-cum-Road Vehicles over Indian Railways.

Seventy per cent of the existing fleet of machines have been manufactured by a world's leading manufacturer with a local content in the range of 20 per cent to 50 per cent.

Modernisation: This year saw improved sleepers and fittings. In order to strengthen track structure, a wider and heavier sleeper has been developed in 2014 which is fit for 25 t axle load at 100 kmph. After successful field trial over five Zonal Railways wider and heavier sleeper has been adopted and approved for full use from FY 2019-20. This is done in a record time of 3 years from drawing board to insertion in field for trial against normal period of 8-10 years.

A web based system for granting permission of track crossing related to various public utilities like water, sewerage, gas pipeline, OFC cable has been developed and made operational on Indian Railways since April 1, 2015.

This system provides submission of online application and knowing status of the same till permission is granted. This avoids the frequent visits of the user to the Railway Offices for knowing the status of application.

To expedite clearance of track crossing cases, power to accord sanction is delegated to DRM for all the cases.A web based application called Land Management Module integrated with Track Management System (TMS) of Indian Railways has been developed, for maintaining centralized land data that is details of acquisition/area/usages and land plans of Land Bank of Indian Railways in digitized form.

Indian Railways has already completed most of the work related to digitization of land record.Station beautification became an important constituent of development this year as Railways launched an innovative initiative for the station beautification with wall art of paints and graffiti or local arts with participation of local artists, private groups and volunteers. At least 65 stations across Zonal railways have been beautified under this initiative by utilising skills of local artists, mostly using local art form, painting style, local themes or contemporary arts.

This initiative provided forum for expression of the emerging talents in the area and visibility of local art forms to the travellers. Balharshah & Chandrapur Railway stations (Central Railway) Madhubani Railway station (East Central Railway) & Madurai Railway station (Southern Railway) Gandhidham Railway station (Western Railway), Kota Railway station (West Central Railway) & Secunderabad Railway station (South Central Railway) have been beautified.

Indian Railways has also commenced work on soft upgradation of 68 stations . This is targeted to be completed by March 31, 2019. This initiative is to give substantial improvement to various passenger amenities like traffic circulation, inter platform transfer, waiting halls, facade improvement, lighting and accessible stations to Divyangjan.

Also Railways introduced many modern trains, coaches in 2018 like Humsafar Trains which have additional amenities in the coaches have recently been introduced for providing comfortable Air-Conditioned III Tier travel. So far 29 Humsafar rakes (9 rakes in 2016-17, 10 rakes in 2017-18, 10 rakes in 2018-19 up to 30.11.18) have been turned out by the Production Units.

Major features of GPS based Passenger information system, passenger announcement system, dust bins in each bay, coffee vending m/c, improved aesthetics pleasing colour scheme, passenger announcement system, closed-circuit television (CCTV) based surveillance system, integrated braille displays have been introduced in the trains.

Passengers could have different experiences through fully geared up Antodaya trains, Deen Dayalu Coaches, Tejas trains. Vistadome coaches with enhanced viewing area including on roof to enable tourists to enjoy panoramic view while travelling. The feature has been well received. Total of four such coaches are in service on scenic sections.

Project Swarn was started to upgrade the condition of Rajdhani and Shatabdi Express Trains, with the objective of significantly improving the passenger experience across 9 dimensions which include coach interiors, toilets, onboard cleanliness, staff behavior, catering, linen, punctuality, security, on-board entertainment. Real time feedback is also a part of Project Swarn. Under this scheme total 29 trains as targeted have been covered at Rs 50 lakh per rake.

Enhancing passenger convenience with an elevated level of comfort and a highly satisfying experience, introduction of ticket booking through mobile phone - UTSONMOBILE App for unreserved ticket booking and IRCTC RAIL CONNECT App for reserved ticket booking, establishment of Yatri Ticket Suvidha Kendras on public private partnership basis for issuing of tickets, launch of the Next Generation E-ticketing System (NGeT) for improving accessibility and enhancing the overall experience of e-ticketing, introduction of Defence Travel System enabling online booking of tickets for defence personnel.

Swachh Bharat: In cleanliness, steps taken by Railways include integrated mechanised cleaning was provided at 488 Railway stations up to March 2018. It is now provided at 697 stations, independent third party Survey of passenger perception on Cleanliness standards of 407 major railway stations carried out first time in 2016 and repeated in 2017 and 201, On Board House Keeping Service (OBHS) is being provided since 2008-09.

Starting from 2008-09, OBHS was provided in 416 pairs of trains up to March, 2014. 448 pairs of trains added in 3 years from 2014-15 to 2016-17. Another 139 added in 2017-18 and 65 more in 2018-19. A total of 1068 trains are presently having facility of this service.

Moreover, all Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto and other important long distance Mail/Express trains are provided with OBHS for cleaning of coach toilets, doorways, aisles and passenger compartments during the run of the trains. Service is supported by sms based on demand ""Clean-my-Coach"" service in 1059 trains, augmented to ""Coach-Mitra"", since 2017-18 to cover over 1020 trains presently. Railways are setting up mechanized laundries for improving quality of washing of linen provided to AC coach passengers.

Starting from 2009-10, 25 mechanised laundries were set up till March, 2014. 32 more mechanised laundries were set up from 2014-15 to 2018-19.

As a part of ""Swachh Bharat Mission"", Railways is proliferating bio-toilets on all its coaching stock so that no human waste is discharged from coaches on to the track. During 2017-18, against the target of 40,000; 57,429 bio-toilets have been provided in 15,017 coaches, as compared to 10,159; 15,442 and 34,134 bio-toilets in 3374, 3,961 and 8,788 coaches in last three years.

Go Green: With a view to transforming Indian Railways into ""Green Railways"" and to capture the economic benefits of electric traction in an accelerated manner, Indian Railways has planned to electrify balance BG routes by 2021-22.

Accordingly, the work for electrification of balance un-electrified BG routes of IR covering 13,675 route kilometers has been approved by CCEA at a cost of Rs 12,134.50 crore. To achieve ambitious target for electrification of balance route, following strategic policy decisions have been taken.

Base off executing agencies have been broadened and projects covering 1,735 RKM have already been entrusted to Govt PSUs i.e. IRCON, RITES and PGCIL. Timelines and approving authorities for various drawings/schematic/plan approval for RE projects have been re-defined. It has been decided that ""Henceforth, where, electrification and doubling works are sanctioned; both works shall be executed by the same agency.""

In its green initiatives for saving the environment, assessment and rating of IRs Production Units and major Workshops as Green Industrial Units started with 'GreenCo' certification of two workshops and one production unit in 2016-17. Thirtyone more Workshops, 4 more Production Units, 2 Diesel Sheds, one Stores depot and 2 STCs have been 'GreenCo' certified since. Twentytwo of these units have been certified in current financial year 2018-19.

Eight railway stations and two Railway schools have achieved green certification. Six out of these eight railway stations achieved Green Certification in 2018-19.

Rail Nilayam/ Secunderabad, IRICEN/Pune and Administrative building of ICF/Chennai are also certified as Green buildings. Railway Hospital Ajmer is the first railway hospital to achieve Green rating recently.

In Railway Electrification, during 2017-18, 4,087 RKM of BG routes have been commissioned on electric traction against target of 4,000 RKM. Up to December 15, 1,667 RKMs has been commissioned on electric traction in 2018-19. Achievement on electrification during corresponding period of 2017-18 was 1,648 RKM."

This was a year for consolidating the gains that have accrued from major policy decisions taken in the previous four years, a time for monitoring of ongoing projects, tackling road blocks and adding to the already impressive pace of work achieved last year. The Ministry took a decision to complete all ongoing projects that had been awarded upto 2015-16, and placed the highest ever target of constructing at least 12,000 kms of national highways as against 9829 kms achieved during 2017-18, and make special efforts to take this length to 16000 km. Overall, more than about 61,300 km length of road projects, costing more than Rs. 6.48 lakh crore, are in progress at present. The balance ongoing works (which have been awarded, appointed dates declared and works going on at sites) are more than 30,200 kms during the year. In the first nine months of FY 2018-19, 5,759 km has been completed in 18-19 against 4,942 km up to same period in last year.

1.2 In order to achieve this target the Ministry brought in policies, guidelines and practices for expediting pre-construction activities and bringing in more efficiency and transparency in the process. The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS)was developed to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC Mode. BhoomiRashi portal is being used extensively for expediting the process of notification for land acquisition. The portal BIMS and BhoomiRashi portals have further been linked with Public Financial Management System(PFMS) to facilitate real time payment to beneficiaries.

1.3 On the finance front too, National Highways Authority of India did a successful financial closure of its first project under Toll- Operate -Transfer this year andoffered 586 km of national highways under the second bundle. The first TOT bundle of 9 projects, totaling approximately 681 KM of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded earlier during the year for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority's estimate. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also got an unsecured loan of Rs 25,000 crore from State Bank of India for 10 years with 3 years of moratorium on repayments. This is the largest amount of loan to have been sanctioned to NHAI in one stroke by any institution. This is also the largest long term unsecured loan sanctioned by SBI at a time to any entity.

A two days long exercise was conducted to review of over 700 ongoing National Highway projects in the country, and over 300 projects were identified to be completed by 2019 achieving the highest ever construction in financial year 2018-19.

The table below details the trends of NH construction over the years.

This is the umbrella program for the highways sector unrolled in 2017-18, that aims to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. 34,800 km of National Highways are to be constructed under the Phase-I of the programme between 2017-18 to 2021-22 in a phased manner at a cost of Rs. 5,35,000 crore. This includes 5,000 kms of the National Corridors, 9000 kms of Economic Corridors, 6000 km of Feeder Corridors and Inter-Corridors, 2000 kms of Border Roads, 2,000 kms of Coastal Roads and Port Connectivity Roads and 800 kms of Green-field Expressways.

Projects for 6,407 km road length have been awarded under the BharatmalaPariyojana(including residual NHDP) till the end of October this year. DPRs are being prepared for projects for the balance length. De- congestion projects have been completed for 13 out of 191 congestion points identified, and are under progress for de-congestion of 80 other points. In addition, DPRs are being prepared for 93 congestion points.Out of the 35 locations identified for Multimodal Logistics Parks, DPRs have been initiated for 7 locations and availability of land parcels is being confirmed with State Governments for the rest of the locations.

In order to ensure safe and smooth flow of traffic, Ministry has envisaged a plan for replacement of Level Crossings on National Highways by ROBs/ RUBs under a scheme known as SetuBharatam. Under this programme, out of 174 ROBs/RUBs which are to be constructed, 91 have been sanctioned with an estimated cost of Rs.7,104.72 crore. Out of 91 sanctioned, 59 ROBs/RUBs have been awarded which are in various stages of progress.

The project envisages development of easy access to the four prominent Dhams, namely, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedranath and Badrinath, situated in the state of Uttrakhand. These four Dhams are prominent pilgrimage centres. The project entails development of 889 km of roads with configuration of two-lane with paved shoulders at an estimated cost of about Rs. 12,000 crore. The projects are being taken up on EPC mode and the programme is targeted for completion by March, 2020.

The two projects of Peripheral Expressways around Delhi, comprising 135 km Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), and 135 km Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) connecting NH-1 and NH-2 from Western and Eastern side of Delhi was completed this year and inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May 2018 and November 2018 respectively. The EPE was constructed by NHAI and WPE by Haryana Government. The two expressways were envisaged with the twin objectives of decongesting and de-polluting the national capital by diverting the traffic not destined for Delhi.

The EPE stretches from Kundli on NH 1 to Palwal on NH 2, and was constructed at a cost ofRs. 4617.87 crore, in addition to Rs. 5900crorewere spent on acquiring 1700 acres of land. It was completed in a record time of about 500 days against the scheduled target of 910 days. It is a fully access-controlled six-lane expressway with a closed tolling system. The expressway has an iconic toll plaza equipped with electronic toll collection infrastructure, ITS control system of the entire EPE and a digital art gallery, with holographic models of major structures and making of the EPE. Weigh-in-Motion equipment at all 30 entry points, solar power on the entire length, eight solar power plants with a capacity of 4000 KW, rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation and 36 replicas of monuments depicting Indian culture and heritage are major features of this expressway. This project has generated employment opportunities of about 50 lakh man-days.

The 8.36 km long Package -1 of the projects was inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May this year. It is a 14 lane, access-controlledsection stretching from Nizammudin Bridge to Delhi UP Border, and was completed in a record time of 18 months as against the earlier expected construction period of 30 months, at a cost of about Rs. 841.50 crore. This is the first National Highway in the country with 14 lanes, and has several features that would help reduce pollution. These include a 2.5-metre-wide cycle track on either side of the highway, a vertical garden on the Yamuna Bridge, solar lighting system and watering of plants through drip irrigation only.

Package II from UP Border to Dasna(19.28 km), Package -III - Dasna to Hapur( 22.27) km and Package -IV - Green-field Alignment from Dasna to Meerut -(31.78 km) are under construction and are likely to be completed by March 2019.

The 473 km expressway will link Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway to Mumbai-Pune Expressway thus providing Expressway connectivity from Ahmedabad to Pune for a length of about 650 Km.

This 1250 km Expressway is being developed along a new alignment between Delhi and Mumbai, which passes through backward and tribal districts of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. A sum of one lakh crore rupees will be spent on this expressway.It will reduce the distance between Delhi and Mumbai from the present 1450km through NH 8 to 1250 km, and the travel time to 12 hours. The sections of proposed highway from Delhi to Dahod in Rajasthan are under tendering, while the section between Vadodara to Ankleshwar in Gujarat have already been awarded. The DPR is under progress for the remaining sections.

DPR is under progress for this 260 km Expressway. This is a green-field alignment. There are two existing roads connecting Bangalore-Chennai, one is via Hoskote (Bangalore)-AP then to Chennai & second is via Electronic City (Bangalore) Hosur(Tamil Nadu) and then to Chennai. The alignment of the proposed expressway is passing in between these two stretches.

Greenfield alignment is being explored for this 500 km long proposed Expressway.

DPR has been awarded and alignment finalization is under progress for the new green-field 940 km Nagpur - Hyderabad - Bangalore EXP.

DPR is in progress for 75 km of Kanpur - Lucknow EXP

Hon'ble Prime Minister inaugurated the 16.55 km, Rs 759.36 crore Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I and 17.25 km, Rs 812.59 crore Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 in November. It has reduced the travel time from Varanasi to the airport, and is proving a big relief to the people of Varanasi and to tourists providing a more convenient access to Sarnath, an important site for Buddhist pilgrimage.

The Ministry has taken up construction of a signature 4-lane Bridge to connect the mainland at Okha to Byet-Dwarka Island off the Gujarat Coast with this SignatureBridge spanning a length of 2.32 kms. The Project has been awarded on 01.01.2018 at a cost of Rs. 689.47 crores. This will be the longest span cable stayed bridge in India with the main span of 500 mtrs. The project is scheduled to be completed in a period of 30 months.

Approval has been given for a project for construction of 9.9 km long new 6 - lane bridge across river Ganga on NH - 96 at Phaphamau in Allahabad with total capital cost of Rs. 1948.25 crore. The construction period for the project is three years and likely to be completed by December, 2021. The new bridge will resolve the traffic congestion on existing old 2 - lane Phaphamau bridge on NH-96 at Allahabad. The new bridge will also facilitate to the large congregation of people at Holy City Allahabad during Kumbh, Ardh-Kumbh and other yearly ritual baths at SANGAM in Prayag. This will give a boost to pilgrimage tourism and local economy of Holy city of Prayag. This new 6 - lane bridge will also be beneficial for the Lucknow / Faizabad bound traffic coming from Madhya Pradesh via National Highway - 27 and National Highway - 76 through Naini Bridge. In addition, this project of new bridge will generate direct employment during construction for about 9.20 lakh mandays.

Approval was given to a project for construction of 6.930 km long 4-lane bridge at Phulaut in Bihar, along with approval for rehabilitation and up-gradation of existing Birpur- Bihpur section of National Highway-106. The construction of this new Bridge will fill the existing 30 km long gap between Udakishanganj and Bihpur of National Highway Number 106 in Bihar, which will provide through connectivity between Nepal/ North Bihar/ East-West Corridor (passing through NH- 57) and South Bihar/ Jharkhand/ Golden Quadrilateral (passing through NH -2), besides full utilization of National Highway Number-31.

A network of 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks had been identified for development in the Phase - 1 of BharatmalaPariyojana. The availability of the land parcels for development of Multimodal Logistics Parks has been confirmed at 7 locations and DPRs have been initiated in all the nodes.

This is a project for constructing a 14.150 km long, 2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir. This would be India's longest road tunnel and the longest bi-directional tunnel in Asia. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the construction, operation and maintenance of the 2- Lane, 4.532 Km long Bi-directional Silkyara Bend - Barkot Tunnel on Dharasu-Yamunotri section along NH -134 in the State of Uttarakhand. The project forms part of the Chardham Plan. The construction period of the project is 4 years at an estimated cost of Rs. 1383.78 crore. Once complete, this stretch will reduce the travel distance from Dharasu to Yamunotri by about 20 Km and travel time byaboutanhour.It will also provide all weather connectivity to Yamunotri, encouraging regional socio-economic development, trade and tourism within the country. The project will be implemented by National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (NHIDCL).

Around Rs. 1,90,000 crore worth of projects have been sanctioned for the construction of road projects for over 12,000 km in the North East region. The projects being executed by NHIDCL are to the tune of Rs. 1, 66,026 crore, covering 10,892 km of roads in all the eight NE states. Projects costing Rs. 17,257 crore have been allotted to the respective state PWDs. Further, projects costing Rs. 7,000 crore are entrusted to the NHAI.

The Ministry has focused on completion of on-going projects along with sanction and award of new projects. A total of 73 projects (8,187 km) worth an estimated investment of Rs.1,00,000 crore wereidentified as Languishing Projects. The reasons for delay were identified and policy interventions undertaken to address the same.

The Ministry is monetizing its road assets constructed with public funds through Toll-Operate-Transfer (ToT) scheme. The scheme envisages bidding of bundled national highways for a concession period of 30 years. The first bundle comprised 9 projects, totalling 681 km of roads in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. It was awarded in 2018 to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the NHAI's estimate.The second bundle comprises over 586 kms spread over four states - Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar. The offer has 12 toll plazas across four highways.

TheNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU)withtheStateBankofIndiatoreceiveRs.25,000croreasa long-term,unsecuredloanfor10years.Thisisthelargestamountofloantohavebeen sanctioned by the SBl in one go. This is also the largest ever fund that NHAI has ever received in one go.

The Ministry has issued detailed guidelines for determination of proper alignment of NH projects, advising executing agencies to examine the feasibility of a green- field alignment, especially in the case of economic corridors, instead of widening existing highways. This has been done because widening involves acquisition of land for Right of Way (RoW), shifting of utilities and demolition of built up structure, all of which involves a lot of time and cost. Also, earlier highways were largely planned to be serpentine, linking all possible towns in the vicinity. This road geometry has been found to be sub optimal, especially in case of economic corridors. BharatmalaPariyojanaalso calls for a corridor approach for economic corridors. It has also been found in a few test cases that it is feasible to acquire a RoW of 60 to 70 mtrs for a green field road project at the same cost as involved in the expansion of an existing road, especially when the associated costs and time taken in utility shifting, tree felling, additional compensation for demolition of structures coming in the RoW under expansion are taken into account.

AWebUtilityhasbeendevelopedwherebythelandacquisitionprocedureforthe NH projects, including processing of all LA related gazette notifications, are being done through a common platform called ""BhoomiRashi"". The Utility has been linked with the e-gazette platform of the MinistryofUrbanDevelopment,GovernmentofIndia,forpublicationofGazette Notifications.TheuseofBhumi Rashi has helped in cutting down the processing time from 2 to 3 months earlier to one to two weeksnow.

BhoomiRashi has also been integrated with the Public Financial Management System(PFMS)platformoftheMinistryofFinancefordepositofcompensationin theaccountsoflandowners/interestedpersonsonarealtimebasis, instead of being parked with CALA.

The Ministry has developed a Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC mode for all NH works and centrally sponsored works.BIMS acts as a data base for allbasic details of bidders like civil works experience, cash accruals and network, annual turnover etc,. This allows quick pre-qualification assessment of bidders based on evaluation parameters like threshold capacity and bid capacity from already stored data.

To improve ease in licensing, this Ministry has simplified the driving license application form. Four forms i.e. (a) Learner License, (b) Driving License, (c) Renewal of License, and (d) updation of Address - all have been consolidated into one. The new form will enable Aadhar based verification of the applicant's identity to provide online services for renewal, change of address etc. Another highlight of the new form is that it would capture an applicant's willingness for organ donation.

The permissible safe axle weight of goods vehicles was revised and increased by about 15% to 20 % for different configurations of axles. The decision was taken with a view to help in increasing the carrying capacity of goods transport vehicles and bring down logistics cost. The amendment will increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 % and lower logistics costs by about 2%. It will also bring down the incidence of overloading. While automobile technology and road construction quality have improved greatly over the years, the axle loads have remained the same since 1983 when they were last notified. There was a felt need to harmonize the axle load with international standards.

NHAI has developed a matrix-based methodology to rank the Fee Plazas on parameters such as electronic tolling, time taken in clearance of FASTag lanes, display panels, staff behaviour, cleanliness, etc. The data for the matrix is to be collected by the Regional Officers who will use the same to rank the Fee Plazas under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, a countrywide drive was launched by NHAl on more than 300 toll plazas across the country on 10 February, 2018, to address issues that affect highway users. Officers visited toll plazas and addressed issues of user convenience and took feedback from the people.

6.3 Linkage of PFMS with Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) and BhoomiRashi

The two IT initiatives of this Ministry, which are aimed at expediting pre- construction processes relating to bidding and land acquisition respectively, have now been integrated with the Public Financial management System (PFMS). The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) is aimed at streamlining the process of pre-qualification of bidders for EPC Mode of contracts for National Highway workswithenhanced transparency and objectivity. The BhoomiRashiportal of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways allows for totally digital and paper-less processing of land acquisition cases, and has resulted in transparent, quick, corruption-free and error-free handling of land acquisition cases. It has alsomade the possible real-time tracking of activities and generation of reports relating to land acquisition. Revenue records of about 7 lakh villages across the country have been integrated in the portal. This digital change has drastically reduced the time taken for issuance of land acquisition notifications from 3-6 months to 1-2 weeks. Over 2000 notifications have already been issued by the Ministry in the first eight months of this financial year that while during the past two years, about a thousand land acquisition notifications could be issued every year. The process has also brought transparency in the system. Earlier the approved compensation amount used to be parked with the CALA (Competent Authority for Land Acquisition) but with BhoomiRashi portal this amount directly transferred into the account of the person concerned, through Public Financial Management System which is an integral part of the portal. In addition to this, the process is also environment friendly since there is no physical movement of files - all work is done digitally.

An advisory has been issued by this Ministry wherein the citizen can produce the transport related documents such as registration, insurance, fitness and permit, the driving licence, certificate for pollution under check and any other relevant documents, if required, in physical or electronic form, on demand by any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorized by the State Government in this behalf. This would enable the use of digital platforms for carrying and verification of the documents and is a step towards citizen facilitation and to ensure so that citizen are not harassed/ inconvenienced.

Here's what to expect in key areas that touch your life. Learning beyond the four walls

Out of class learning is expected to be a key part of the Delhi government's education push in the coming year.

In Delhi government schools, which largely cater to children from economically disadvantaged families, ensuring attendance and establishing a classroom connect with students has been a struggle.

The coming year will see the flagship 'Happiness Curriculum' project completing one year, and implementation of the new 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' for students in classes IX to XII.

Through storytelling, 'mindfulness' classes and interactive activities, 'happiness classes' for students of nursery to Class VIII have tried to help students ""get in touch with their emotions"". The objective of the 'entrepreneurship classes', an official said, will be to develop an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in older children to help them re-orient their goals -- from simply seeking jobs towards innovation.

Shailendra Sharma, principal advisor to the Delhi government, said these curricular interventions are laying the ground for changing the education discourse in classrooms. ""The whole point of happiness classes is to reorient relationships between teachers, students and parents. Students are getting the opportunity to reflect on their thoughts and express themselves without fear of judgement, while teachers can experience their relationship with students beyond just teaching. This is setting the ground for the larger goal of education beyond knowledge transmission.""

On the 'entrepreneurship curriculum', he said, ""Hopefully, this will also help take the discourse to the next level, in terms of what students feel like they're ready for after stepping out of school and what roles they see for themselves in the public arena.""

Education, many believe, is also tied closely to AAP's political fortunes. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has often spoken about education reforms in Delhi during his rallies outside the state; AAP leader Atishi, best known for her work in the field of education, has been made a Lok Sabha candidate; and AAP has frequently harnessed the 'happiness curriculum' for international recognition -- most recently during an education conference in Austria in December.

Even though heads of schools have given positive feedback on happiness classes in review meetings -- such as a greater sense of belonging and an increase in attendance -- some have expressed concern that the flurry of new interventions take away time, effort and focus from the core need to deliver examination results.

This year, several schools delivered zero pass percentages in the internal examinations. The ability to match these interventions with results will be tested in 2019, particularly with children in board examination classes being brought under their ambit.

Move to check overpricing by hospitals

The Delhi government is set to roll out guidelines to regulate private hospitals and nursing homes. Once implemented, the policy is expected to be a landmark decision for Delhi residents who have often complained of overpricing by various private hospitals.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told The Indian Express that the government will implement the guidelines by early 2019. The advisory was framed after the AAP government formed a nine-member committee, headed by the then Director-General of Health Services Kirti Bhushan, to monitor functioning of private hospitals.

The aim is to ensure rates of surgery packages are ""transparent, without hidden charges"", and hospitals disclose whether they cover any complications during the procedure.

The draft advisory states that private hospitals can charge patients for medicines at the MRP mentioned in the National List of Essential Medicines, 2015, as their prices have already been capped. The policy also prohibits private hospitals and nursing homes from refusing to hand over bodies over pending bills.

""The department is finalising work on the committee report and will release it soon. The guidelines will change the entire scenario of the medical profession,"" said a senior health department official.

In 2019, Delhi will also witness implementation of the Centre's ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme, which has run into some turbulence in the capital over the name of the scheme. At the moment, both sides are in a deadlock.

It has so far been implemented in four government hospitals -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College -- as well as a few private hospitals. The National Health Agency has asked private hospitals in the capital to join the insurance scheme, and 2019 will tell how many follow through.

AAP and Cong: Will they, won't they?

Wild swings in vote shares of the three big political players, AAP, BJP and Congress, which have come to characterise the city's politics since 2014, will largely determine the churning that lies ahead.

For the ruling AAP, doing well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is imperative for its ambition to go national. It has received jolts in the recent past owing to successive drubbings in state assembly polls, as seen recently in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The AAP's political fortunes appear to be tied closely with that of the Congress, with the two parties competing for acceptance among the same sections -- from residents of unauthorised colonies to Purvanchalis -- while the BJP continues to draw support from traders and the upper-middle class.

This is where coalition talks come in: Despite their apparent mutual dislike, there has been no outright rejection from the AAP and the Congress that they are in talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" so that the BJP does not romp home once again by taking advantage of the possible vote cutting.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has so far shied away from giving a straight answer -- whenever asked by reporters, he has maintained: ""We will let you know."" He also insists that the AAP will do ""all that is necessary"" to keep the BJP out of power.

Behind the ambiguous statements are hard facts: In 2015, the AAP won with a 54.3% vote share due to the massive dip in the Congress's vote share, which was down to 9.8%. However, in last year's municipal polls, Congress showed signs of revival as it increased its share to 21.09%, while AAP's came down to 26.23%.

On the other hand, the BJP's vote share has remained more or less constant -- 33.07% in the 2015 Assembly polls and 36.23% in the 2017 MCD polls. Only in 2014 had the BJP notched up an impressive share of 44.81%, on the back of a country-wide Modi wave that swept the party to power.

While back-channel talks may or may not yield results, the AAP has been critical of the Congress in public. At rally after rally, Kejriwal tried to drive home the point that voting for the Congress will end up strengthening the BJP. Addressing one such rally in August, he had said that the Delhi Congress has been reduced to a ""vote cutter for the AAP"".

Leaders in the AAP also point to the fact that Delhi will go to Assembly polls in less than a year after the Lok Sabha elections, and any coalition with the Congress in 2019 may end up harming AAP's prospects in 2020.

""What happens in the Lok Sabha elections will also have a bearing on the Assembly polls. Some leaders in AAP are looking at an alliance because arithmetic says both parties together will be able to keep the BJP out of power. But the implications have to be seen in context of the Assembly polls. Will AAP want to align with the very party whose vote bank shifted to it en masse in 2015?"" said a former party leader.

The Delhi Congress, still smarting from the 2015 drubbing, currently under the leadership of Ajay Maken, disapproves of all coalition talks. It has maintained that the AAP is a ""B-team"" of the BJP and that the Kejriwal-led party is ""desperate to stitch an alliance for its own survival"".

Eight years on, 1,500 buses may roll out

For a city that has been waiting for new buses to join its fleet since 2011, the coming year is going to be a crucial one. At least 500 standard-floor buses, with hydraulic lifts to make them accessible to the differently abled, have already got a go-ahead from courts.

Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said 1,000 electric buses will also join the close to 6,000 buses on Delhi roads by June. ""The Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System is preparing a feasibility report, after which tenders will be floated,"" he said.

If all goes according to plan, Delhi will become the first Indian city to have such a large electric bus fleet. This will also be key to Delhi's fight against pollution -- according to recent studies by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and TERI, vehicular pollution contributes to over 35% of particulate matter in the city.

With construction of Metro Phase IV getting the green signal, the other gap that remains is providing last-mile connectivity.

Recently, the Delhi Metro tied up with private app-based cab aggregators to fill this gap. However, in an ever-expanding city, buses and a regulated e-rickshaw service are being seen as the only way to make sure people are incentivised to leave their personal vehicles at home and switch to greener modes of travel.

1.4 lakh cameras on streets, 1 lakh in schools

Education and health will be the focus of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2019. According to a senior PWD official, ""by the end of 2019, the aim is to construct 12,000 additional classrooms in Delhi government schools"".

The department will also begin work on the hotly debated plan to install CCTV cameras inside schools. ""Over 1 lakh cameras will be put inside 726 schools. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 600 crore so far,"" said Sanjeev Rastogi, PWD PRO.

Cameras are also supposed to be installed in public places, such as markets, across the capital. ""The plan is to install 1.4 lakh cameras across the city; the allocated budget is Rs 350 crore,"" Rastogi said.

Also on the agenda is remodelling seven of the 17 government hospitals, and converting 94 dispensaries into polyclinics.

On the traffic front, PWD aims to clear congestion at Shastri Park and Seelampur by building a flyover. ""It's a two-year project to help manage traffic from Shahdara to Kashmere Gate,"" said Rastogi.

Staring at a financial crisis of Rs 3,000 crore, the North and East civic bodies have not undertaken any big projects for 2019, and will instead focus on completing pending projects.

The North Corporation wants to finish multi-level parking projects at Rani Bagh, Shiva Market, Shastri Park, Idgah and Gandhi Maidan to create parking space for 5,000 vehicles.

The East MCD is focusing on Krishna Nagar, Preet Vihar, Geeta Colony, Babarpur and Anand Nagri; and the South MCD on New Friends Colony, Rajouri Garden, Defence Colony and Hauz Khas.

The category existed in previous years. However, the department of public instruction (DPI) says it's not necessary and provides ample room for misuse.

December 10 was the last date for furnishing the relevant information online. But the schools couldn't meet the deadline and on Thursday, they were given another 10 days to comply.

He accused the Congress of protecting those guilty in 1984 anti-Sikh riots and hit out at AAP, saying what happened in the Delhi Assembly over the adoption of a resolution on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots was like ""rubbing salt"" in the victims' wounds.

""There are only three main political parties in Delhi. Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi have told so many lies that no other person can surpass them,"" he said.

Shah said a former Congress leader has been awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court for 1984 Sikh massacre. This could happen because of the Special Investigation Team formed to ensure justice to the Sikhs.

""But I want to ask: why did the Congress protect the guilty person and why it did not take action at the right time?""

""On the other hand, you must have seen a drama in Delhi Assembly which is like rubbing salt in the wounds of Sikhs by Aam Aadmi Party. Today the AAP and Congress have been exposed,"" he said.

He also slammed Rahul Gandhi for accusing Modi government of corruption in the Rafale deal. ""Despite the Supreme Court's judgement on the Rafale deal, he is still lying and levelling allegations,"" he said.

He hit out at Congress accusing it of favouring anti-national forces and making hue and cry over Assam National Register of Citizens (NRC).

""They stood with anti-national forces when surgical strike took place against Pakistan. They did so when the NRC was implemented in Assam. Are not they concerned about the lives of the people who may be killed by the bomb blasts of the infiltrators?"" he said.

Shah said that Kejriwal and his Government has completely failed in fulfilling the promises made to the people.

""Every promise of Kejriwal has proved to be false. Be it for 500 schools, three hospitals in every Lok Sabha Constituency, deputing marshals for women in DTC buses, installing CCTV cameras or providing drinking water,"" he said."

The attack on AAP came after the party sought to distance itself from the resolution, which it said, did not have official backing. The BJP chief accused the ruling party in Delhi of being insincere.

Shah also targeted Congress, saying perpetrators of the anti-Sikh riots were presenting themselves as protectors while also criticising the party for protecting illegal immigrants, a reference to the main opposition's stance on the issue of the National Register of Citizens in Assam.

""The lies of Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi outweigh all the lies spoken since independence in the country.

Referring to the adoption of a resolution on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots by the Delhi Assembly, which witnessed confusion after an AAP MLA slipped in a line on withdrawing former PM Rajiv Gandhi's Bharat Ratna, BJP president Amit Shah Sunday said it was akin to ""rubbing salt"" on the victims' wounds.

On Friday, the Assembly had passed a resolution urging the Centre to withdraw the Bharat Ratna awarded to Rajiv, alleging that he justified the riots. But the party had later distanced itself from this, maintaining that the demand did not make it to the final resolution unanimously passed through voice vote.

Deputy CM Manish Sisodia had later said it was merely a proposal from an individual MLA, and that the AAP does not support the proposal on taking back the country's highest civilian award from Rajiv. Speaker Ram Niwas Goel had said he had never allowed the tabling of the ""amendment"" to the original resolution circulated among the MLAs.

Speaking to more than 12,000 workers, Shah said Sikh victims had been denied justice for so many years because ""the perpetrators of the riots were also the protectors (of the accused)"". He said it was only after the BJP came to power that justice was assured through the formation of a special investigation team and providing compensation to families of victims.

Shah also appealed to booth-level workers to take forward the message that if they choose Narendra Modi as Prime Minister in the 2019 elections, it will be last nail in the coffin of the Congress's ""nepotism and casteism"".

He asked workers to visit residents with a copy of the AAP's manifesto, and tell them how the party has not fulfilled its promises of constructing new schools and hospitals and installing CCTV cameras. ""Where are the hospitals, schools, marshals in buses for women's security and CCTVs? The condition of mohalla clinics is such that filth and dogs have been found in many,"" he alleged.

Shah said the Modi government, on the other hand, had fulfilled all its promises for Delhi and that the BJP will give an account of its work to voters in the 2019 elections. ""It is unfortunate that the Arvind Kejriwal government did not allow implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi, fearing Modi will gain popularity,"" he said.

Addressing the booth level party workers and leaders in Delhi, Mr Shah said that there were countless reasons to vote Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power again. He said, the BJP's victory in 2019 polls would ensure that the country's politics was free from these negative practices in politics.

Mr Shah said, in Delhi, the contest would be mainly between three major players - BJP, AAP and Congress. He alleged that till date, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal and Congress Chief Rahul Gandhi spoke the highest number of lies in the history of politics.

Hitting out at Congress over the 1984 riots, Mr Shah asked why did such delay happen in delivering justice to the families of the riot victims. He alleged that the riots took place under the patronage of Congress.

He said when BJP Government came to power it formed Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the anti-Sikh riots cases which led to speedy probe and now justice was being delivered to the victims.

After coming to power, BJP Government announced 5 lakh compensation, formation of SIT and benefits for the riot victims.

Referring to Delhi Assembly resolution over the anti-Sikh riots, Mr Shah said it was like rubbing salt to the wounds of the Sikh community, and AAP should be ashamed of what they did.

He said the AAP Government in Delhi failed to deliver what they promised during elections and the long list of the promises has a list of their failures.

The people in Delhi are drinking dirty water, he said adding that promises of CCTV cameras and marshals in DTC buses, and opening of 500 schools by AAP remained unfulfilled.

He said Delhi citizens were suffering because of failure of AAP Government but Mr Kejriwal is not ready to accept the same.

Hitting out at the Mohalla clinics, Mr Shah said that instead of opening hospitals, AAP Government opened mohalla clinics, most of which were without doctors, pharmacists and basic facilities.

Mr Shah said, the surgical strike had put India into the big league of the US and Israel that were known for hitting back at enemies that attack their security forces.

The Council of Higher Secondary Education (CHSE) has directed the schools to keep generators or UPS ready to avoid inconvenience during the examinations in case of power failure.

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination.

Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina.

The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang.

They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

A child stands near a large screen showing photos of Xi Jinping in Kashgar, western China's Xinjiang region.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories.

Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang.

A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before.

The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang.

""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained.

The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

Buildings are seen around the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux.

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road.

In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign.

They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls.

Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report.

Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience.

Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility.""

Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller.

The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up.

But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory.

In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements.

Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College.

However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years.

He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China.

Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan.

But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments.

The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia.

The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there.

But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump administration on Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith.

""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not be importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping.

Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases.

The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Orynbek Koksebek, a former detainee in a Chinese internment camp.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp.

Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories.

The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks.

Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A police station is seen inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls.

The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program.

Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training.""

The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away.

They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp.

He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday.

Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said.

""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

According to the report, none of the schools had female security guards, many students are yet to receive stationery money. Only 62 schools, of total 344, have CCTV cameras installed in them.

In almost 14 schools, more than 5,000 students are forced to sit on floors, as there are no desks and benches, and around 44 schools do not have Jal Board's water connections.

As per the report, a press statement released by SDMC in June stated that within four months, 4,348 CCTV cameras will be installed in 344 primary schools.

AAP councilor from Sitapur, Praveen Kumar Praveen Kumar, raised questions about the predicament of the schools in the meeting and accused the ruling BJP of making tall promises but failing to execute them.

Nandini Sharma, the South Corporation Education committee chairperson, said, ""The files have been moved. Tenders are being invited, and work orders will be issued. We are expecting to get things moving by February.""

She cited lack of funding as the reason for the woes of school and said, ""We received Rs 46 crore instead of Rs 89 crore in funds. We are giving Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,100 to students as a subsidy for uniforms""."

""All our efforts have been targeted towards conducting the examination without any untoward incident. Section 144 is the latest edition towards this effort,"" SEBA sources said.

Apart from the provision of four closed circuit television cameras in each examination centre, the areas where sorting of question papers and examination booklets are done will also be under CCTV surveillance.

Writing in black ink has been made mandatory for examinees as it was done in the previous examination.

To facilitate convenience in the examination centres located in far-flung areas, the Board has introduced the provision for centre committee approval through the Inspector of Schools.

The editorial claims that the EVM is, after all, the messenger of people's will and not the will itself. Is it?

What if, just what if, the EVM has grown a sense of the self? What if it has developed something akin to anthropoid greed? What if it has discovered the august company of Cambridge Analytica and can approximate voter behaviour and choice? If nothing else, are we to believe that it does not savour its 15 minutes of infamy when it malfunctions and all hell breaks loose? Are we to believe it does not like the attention when political specimens of every gene clamour for its blood? Are we to believe that the on-air surgeries performed on it are not akin to adrenalin-pushing, TRP-bursting game-shows?

Who does not like all this? If the EVM behaves well, acts as per the book, causes no storm over the South Block tea-cup, will the gentile and the Jew ever rave about it on social media? Oh no, dear editor, no one talks about a good citizen these days. Otherwise, why was everyone on their toes when there was a power failure and the hawk-eye of the CCTV went missing for 76 minutes in a Bhopal strongroom on December 7? All the efficient donkey's work that the Good Joe EVM performed over the days of the elections, all the silent transportation, all the winkless hours of standing in attendance in darkened rooms have gone unnoticed. But a brief error of 76 minutes has raised everyone's heckles. Nothing sells like notoriety or why pay the trolls?

After all, there is merit in tinkering and tailoring the EVM. One little displacement in the network of cables and chips inside can be oh so fulfilling! Fool the people, keep them hungry and jobless, tread cruelly on promises made, decimate earnings and savings and then quietly doctor the EVM. And bingo! Whichever button is pressed, the endorsement turns green, saffron or red.

Have you heard the phrase scientific rigging? Once upon a time many moons ago, there was a party in Bengal which had christened itself as Blah Blah Red Party. They talked a lot and did very little work. But one thing they did with rapt attention. They could calculate, almost with zero margin of error, the nitty-gritty of each election from below. They could make gargantuan mathematics about booth-wise voting patterns, they knew the algorithm of support across every household and the algebra of tomfoolery that would bring their voters to the booth and transfer their will to the party's symbol, thunderously stamping their name on the ballot paper. How? By ""scientific rigging"". Meaning? A suave, secret and polished arrangement (made in cohort with underlings of the party) to ensure that maximum was voting on their side. But how? Well, you could cajole, threat or affiance the opposing candidate during nominations. Or for the voter on their way to the polling booth, you could send stern missives to their homes in their absence; you could bring back to life dead or absent voters on the day of polling, you could whisk away the invigilating officer from the polling room, you could misinform date and time of voting to unlettered villagers, you could arrange for food and drink for suspect voters holding them back from the polling station etc. These were fairy-tale virtues of the Red Party, taught earnestly in night schools for comrades.

Now think of it this way. All this hard work taking months, all this planning taking weeks, all this calculation eating up papers can be brought to a naught with one single, magic surgery on the EVM.

Thomas Hobbes considered human life, in natural surroundings, as ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"". For him, the parliament was a possible answer. But the dusty way to that parliament in our country, dear editor, is no less poor or nasty or brutish. And a little doctoring of the EVM can ensure that it is short too."

The government school in her home town, Chopasni village, can now give competition to city schools after it was upgraded with help from donors. Chanchal and her elder sister Pratibha study in the village school now.

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Sarla Ratnoo, a student of class 12, said: ""I can dream big now as I can continue with my education. Had the school been far away or without facilities, it would not have been possible.""

The school has a strength of more than 350 students and provides Identity cards and uniforms. ""CCTV cameras have been installed in the classes. The teachers and I keep watch over every activity in the school. We keep organising sports and other extra-curricular activities from time to time to give boost students' exposure,"" said the proud principal."
