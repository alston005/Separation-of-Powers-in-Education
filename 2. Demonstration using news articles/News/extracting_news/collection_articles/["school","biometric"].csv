Amid privacy concerns over Aadhaar, amendments have been planned in the Act, under which the government also proposes to arm the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) with more powers, similar to that of regulators, sources said.

The Aadhaar Act, at present, does not empower the body to take enforcement action against errant entities in the Aadhaar ecosystem.

Children, holding Aadhaar, will have the option of cancellation of the 12 digit biometric identifier within a period of six months of attaining 18 years of age. The consent of a parent or guardian will be must for enrolling a child, while no child will be denied any subsidy, benefits or services for lack of Aadhaar, as per the proposed changes.

The proposed amendments also make provision for 'Virtual ID' and voluntary and offline modes of using Aadhaar.

A bill to amend the Aadhaar Act, the Indian Telegraph Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

Besides, the government also plans to set up a UIDAI fund under the Aadhaar Act and has proposed that the authority be exempt from taxes on income.

Mooting fines for violation of the Aadhaar Act, the draft provisions say that a new section will be added to provide for civil penalties, which may extend to Rs 1 crore for each contravention on failure to comply with provisions of the Act, rules, regulations and directions by any entity in the Aadhaar ecosystem. The Aadhaar ecosystem includes enrolling agencies, registrars, requesting entities, offline verification seeking entities and any other entity or group as may be specified by regulations. It further mooted an additional penalty of up to Rs 10 lakh for each day of continuing non-compliance after the first contravention. Punishment for unauthorised access to the Central Identities Data Repository as well as data tampering is proposed to be extended to 10 years each from the current three years.

According to sources, the government is keen to give UIDAI regulatory powers, considering the fact that over 122 crore Aadhaar numbers have been issued across the country but the authority does not currently have powers to take enforcement actions against errant entities. There will be a provision to file appeal before the TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal), and against the orders of TDSAT an appeal can be made in the Supreme Court. The government also plans to amend the Telegraph Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to provide for voluntary use of Aadhaar for obtaining SIMs and opening bank accounts.

The Supreme Court, in a landmark verdict in September last year, had upheld the constitutional validity of 'Aadhaar' but limited the scope of the controversial biometric identity project, ruling it is not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions. Holding that there was nothing in the Aadhaar Act that violates right to privacy of an individual, the SC had cleared the use of Aadhaar for welfare schemes. The court had held that Aadhaar will remain mandatory for filing of I-T returns and allotment of PAN, but struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporate to avail of the biometric Aadhaar data."

He was not able to sleep or focus on anything. His life had come to a standstill. The moment he was dreading had finally arrived. On 12 October (late Friday), the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) had issued a circular to entities operating in the e-payments space to completely halt the use of Aadhaar e-KYC (electronic-know your customer).

Mr. A, the founder of an e-wallet company, who was not able to get clarity from regulators on the usage of Aadhaar post the Supreme Court's verdict, finally got clarity from the circular. But the scramble had only just begun. Life in a world without e-KYC had to be figured out, at least for the time being. But the senior executive team of the e-wallet firm was to get together only on 14 October (Monday) to hash out a way forward.

Three weeks earlier, like most people in the country, Mr. A was glued to his television set from 10.30am, switching from one news channel to other. It was unlike him to be watching TV in the office that early on a weekday, but the day was momentous.

It was 26 September -- the day the Supreme Court weighed in on the fate of the Aadhaar unique identity project. Mr. A recounts how anxious he had become as he waited for the court verdict. ""What happens if Aadhaar-based customer acquisition is banned? What happens to my business model? What happens to all these years of efforts?"" were some of the thoughts that crossed his mind. And then, around 12.30pm, the Constitution bench's verdict was finally out.

While affirming the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, the apex court had said Aadhaar can only be used for welfare schemes and for delivering state subsidies. It had barred private companies from using Aadhaar data for authenticating customers. Also, in order to address privacy concerns, the court said it was not mandatory to link Aadhaar with bank accounts or mobile phone numbers.

For Mr. A and his team, making sense of the 1,448-page judgment itself took time. They brainstormed about the many possible interpretations of the judgment for more than five days, trying to somehow figure out a way to save the business from collapsing. He also did not know when exactly to stop customer verification through the Aadhaar-based mechanism. ""The judgment was not 100% clear on whether it had to be stopped on the same day,"" he said.

While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had updated its KYC guidelines in April 2018, all eyes had been on the Supreme Court. In the meantime though, e-wallet firms had already gone ahead with customer verification models based on Aadhaar. It was just cheaper and far more convenient. But on 14 October, in the internal meeting at Mr.A's company, the top management decided to completely roll back Aadhaar-based customer verification until further clarity came from the regulators. It was a sudden and unexpected speed bump in the path of India's booming fintech industry.

Impact on industry

Like Mr. A, most fintech companies, telecom operators and payment banks had built their business models based on the unique biometric number in order to deliver services in a paperless, cashless and presence-less manner.

""All the pillars of financial inclusion have been impacted with the restricted use of Aadhaar,"" said Suresh Sethi, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), India Post Payments Bank (IPPB). ""It was being used for not only banking and account opening, but other efficiencies were getting introduced -- like the whole concept of instant loans and insurance, and also the ability to invest immediately,"" he added.

IPPB, which used Aadhaar-based e-KYC to verify customers, has not been able to on-board new customers in the last two months. Only customers seeking direct benefit transfer (DBT) have been able to open accounts through Aadhaar-based e-KYC, said Sethi. ""Currently, the account opening per day is 15-20% of what we were doing earlier. The pace of acquisition has slowed down by 75-80%.""

Similarly, other payment banks have also confirmed that they have not been able to on-board new customers other than those seeking DBT as they all use Aadhaar-based KYC to verify customers.

IPPB has been incorporated as a public sector company under the Department of Posts with 100% government equity and is governed by the RBI. The bank was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 1 September to increase access to banking services in rural areas. The postal agents provide doorstep banking and account opening facility using a hand-held device, mobile phone, and a biometric reader.

According to Mr. A, the prepaid payment instruments (PPI) industry caters to around 250 million customers annually and the average cost of doing a physical KYC for each customer is around ₹100. The total cost of verifying these customers physically would be around ₹2,500 crore to the industry.

Even if other forms of identification were listed during customer verification, most customers would voluntarily opt for Aadhaar and this was also easier for us as the customer would be verified on a real-time basis, said Harshil Mathur, CEO and co-founder of Razorpay Software Pvt. Ltd, an online payment solutions company.

Since Aadhaar-based verification is not possible anymore, around 30-40% additional customers have to be physically verified which has significantly ramped up the operational costs for the company.

If the e-KYC suspension was not the only cause of worry for the fintech industry, e-sign based e-mandates used for automated collection of loan payments was also suspended in November by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the umbrella organization for all retail payments in the country. It resulted in even higher operational costs for digital lenders.

According to a circular issued on 23 November by NPCI to banks, the e-sign based e-mandate product has been suspended with effect from 26 November in compliance with the judgment of the Supreme Court.

""A lot of mutual funds and digital lending companies which were moving from physical mandates to Aadhaar-based mandates had to go back to physical mandates which is expensive and inefficient,"" said Mathur of Razorpay. ""For customers too, this is very inefficient. Instead of auto debit every month, customers will have to come and make payments now.""

Some of the fintech firms are now using net banking-based mandate, which is currently live with only five banks. NPCI has plans to launch a debit card-based eNACH which might offer some respite for these companies. A recent report by Omidyar and the Boston Consulting Group said that digital lending to micro, small and medium enterprises in the country is projected to increase between 10-15 times by 2023 to ₹6-7 trillion.

Consumer concerns

The Aadhaar judgment has been lauded as a pro-consumer move by most critics of the project. It has definitely eased the lives of the common people who would get calls and emails from banks, insurance companies, lending companies and telecom operators to update their Aadhaar details. Before 26 September, Aadhaar was mandatory for almost everything including school and hospital admissions. With the Supreme Court doing away with the mandatory linking of Aadhaar, most consumers that Mint spoke with feel that they have finally gotten a chance to decide for themselves and use Aadhaar voluntarily.

Anirudh Sharma, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer recounts how he would get notifications from Paytm every day in July to complete his full KYC. ""I was not able to send money to my friends and family in their Paytm wallets. So, the only option left was to get my full KYC done,"" he said. However, when the Paytm executive came to his doorstep to do his full KYC, he was told that only Aadhaar-based KYC would be possible. The executive was carrying a biometric reader and a mobile phone to complete the process. Despite the quick and easy verification experience, Sharma said, ""I should be the one choosing which identity proof I want to give or not give.""

Similarly, Seema Vashisht, a 46-year-old designer, who runs her own fashion store, said she got her Reliance Jio SIM card a few months ago through Aadhaar e-KYC. She too never got an option to exercise her choice while submitting identity proof documents. ""After getting a mobile phone number based on my Aadhaar number, how can they ask me to link my mobile phone to Aadhaar? Isn't it a two-way process? Why does it involve one process after another?"" she said.

In the absence of a digital fix, which bypasses the bar on e-KYC, the offline process for acquiring a new phone number could take between 24 to 36 hours. In this nebulous sweet spot between convenience and privacy rights, the future of Aadhaar's use by the private sector will be decided. Some experts say the top court judgment requires the use of Aadhaar to be purpose-limited, legally-backed and privacy-protected. They say there may still not be a problem if a person volunteers to give his or her Aadhaar card as proof of identity.

According to a 27-year-old civil services aspirant, who did not wish to be named, every state and the central government entrance exam still lists Aadhaar as the first option among the many documents admissible as a form of identity proof. ""Before the judgment, Aadhaar would be marked compulsory, but now only the word 'compulsory' has been removed. The rest is the same. Aadhaar still is the topmost option in the list of documents and while verification, the examiners also emphasize on Aadhaar for establishing identity when I go to take the test.""

Regulatory uncertainty

Sethi of IPPB said the bank is actively in talks with the regulators to get an alternative KYC process in place. ""We have made various representations to the government and we have very clearly heard from the government that they are working towards finding a way which involves voluntary usage of Aadhaar e-KYC.""

UIDAI has recently introduced an XML-based protocol, which they have shared with RBI, he said. ""RBI is reviewing it to see if it can be a surrogate, paperless process. It basically means that you get on to a portal and you get your Aadhaar data downloaded in the form of an XML file and that file will have all the information needed for opening an account.""

However, the proposed process will depend on the accessibility to the internet. ""Under the new mechanism, a customer will have to go to the bank or kiosk to get the sourced data, which is going to be a bit of a barrier, especially for the segments we are targeting. If we expect them to download and create this file, or go to an enrolment centre and get the file, there are going to be barriers,"" Sethi said.

Mr. A said he has also approached the Payments Council of India (PCI), the industry body for prepaid payments, for exploring all the possible options to be able to conduct his business -- including video-based KYC and artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions.

The AI-based application being considered will help customers send their identity proof over the web, enabling their facial images to be captured by the app from different angles to ensure liveliness. (Liveness is the ability to check whether it is a photograph before the camera or an actual human being). The use of 'offline Aadhaar', which relies on QR (quick response) code instead of biometric e-KYC for customer verification, is also being considered by the central bank, said a person familiar with the development.

But despite the many rounds of meetings and consultations, no clear path forward is yet in place.

The way forward

On 17 December, the government for the first time laid out its cards in the open, with the Union cabinet giving a go-ahead to amend existing laws in order to give legal backing to the voluntary use of Aadhaar. But the regulatory space will continue to be a muddle for quite some time. Any changes in legislation would require parliamentary approval and with a general election in sight, the time available for piloting any amendments through parliament is rather limited. The related big-ticket item of a personal data protection law is also pending.

The Congress, on its part, strongly opposes the use of the biometric ID by private entities. Thus, what's in store seems to be months of uncertainty and impasse.

The prevailing state of affairs has pushed some industry voices to question the logic of a government-mandated standard to begin with. ""What if multiple solutions were encouraged originally?"" asked Ashish Aggarwal, senior director and head of public policy at Nasscom. Instead of getting into how exactly private companies verify their customers, the regulators should just focus on common standards, interoperability, and portability. The market can come up with ideal solutions to solve issues of operational nitty-gritty, Aggarwal said.

Caught up in these larger debates are ordinary people like Mr. A and millions of India's fintech users. Their wait continues as the country's e-wallet boom looks to push past the e-KYC hiccup."

The review petition has been filed by one Imtiyaz Ali Palsaniya, who had also filed interim applications when the apex court was examining the validity of the Aadhaar scheme.

The petition has also sought an open court hearing in the matter.

In the 56-page petition, the petitioner has said it has been preferred in a ""narrow compass"" seeking to challenge only those aspects of the Aadhaar program as well as the Aadhaar Act, 2016 which were held to be constitutionally valid by the constitution bench.

2018 has been a very significant year for privacy and data protection in India, triggered in part by the Aadhaar case and the affirmation of the fundamental right to privacy by the Supreme Court in 2017. A growing privacy consciousness can be seen among the people, with a view to safeguarding their data and their freedom, as can be seen with the outrage that followed the recent MHA notification.

The same consciousness can be seen in the government as well, but from the perspective of recognising the potential of data, and of privacy and data protection laws as a means to enable this, as opposed to protecting the people. The focus of laws and proposed laws thus, by and large, seems to be with the aim of maximising control and utilisation of data, as opposed to safeguarding people's rights. The recently released draft Intermediary Guidelines are reflective of this as well.

Draft Intermediary Guidelines

Meity released a draft of the Intermediary Guidelines for public consultation on 24 December this year. These guidelines, in addition to various proposed provisions in relation to content regulation, propose a 72-hour time limit to respond to government requests for information. Given the broad definition of 'information' under the IT Act, this could include data of any form, even text, images, messages, databases, etc.. This also includes a requirement to trace the originator of such information on its platform. The proposed requirement is reflective of the traceability requirements which were to be imposed on WhatsApp for dealing with the fake news menace.

Such requirements are being proposed without any clarity on corresponding privacy protections for the people. It must be remembered here that while intermediaries like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, etc. are often at the receiving end for their lack of privacy protections in relation to the use they make of the data, they have often turned out to be the only protection people have against governmental access of data (the FBI-iPhone struggle, for instance). These rules put in question the extent of governmental access to data with such intermediaries, and also with the use of encryption as a means of protection for users.

The MHA Notification

The recently issued MHA notification is another such instance, which appointed 10 governmental bodies such as the Intelligence Bureau as agents for the purpose of interception, monitoring and decryption. While the notification was widely misunderstood to be conferring unbridled surveillance powers on these agents, it did have the effect of bringing state surveillance to the forefront of people's privacy concerns.

For the sake of clarity, the notification did not make any change to the existing situation or confer any new surveillance powers on the agents (Read here for a full explanation on this). These powers are already within the IT Act, and the issue with their constitutionality existed from the moment of their introduction into the IT Act, and not with this notification.

Another reason for the huge outrage that followed this notification was possibly owing to the introduction of the need for judicial oversight as a procedural safeguard for sharing of data under the Aadhaar judgment (the striking down of Section 33(2)). As a result, any step forward in relation to Section 69 was expected to be in relation to testing its constitutionality and those of the procedural safeguards under related rules. What was seen instead was the government taking the next steps for more efficient exercise of the existing surveillance powers.

Section 69 of the IT Act and its procedural safeguards have long since been in question for their constitutionality. This is owing to, firstly, their failure to meet privacy standards for surveillance possibilities today, the lack of judicial oversight as required under the Aadhaar judgment, and failure to meet the proportionality test as required under the Right to Privacy Judgment. The safeguards, moreover, are on the lines of those prescribed under the PUCL judgment, a judgment which was delivered almost 20 years ago (1996) and in relation to telephone tapping only. Review of these for their constitutionality is thus essential.

The Personal Data Protection Bill

The attitude of the state towards data protection is further reflected in the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, released in July 2018. On the one hand, it was a good step forward for India to move from next to no privacy law at all to a comprehensive privacy law. On the other hand, the fiduciary relationship put forth by the Bill leads to a situation where instead of giving the individual the ultimate control and ownership of his data, once he hands his data to a data fiduciary or controller, he can only trust that the data fiduciary will handle his data in compliance with the law. This is reflected primarily in the omission of the right to erasure (the right to have a data fiduciary delete all data that he has on the individual) among the rights granted to the individuals.

The effect is thus that while the law imposes a number of welcome obligations on the data fiduciaries, the people are not sufficiently empowered in relation to their data. The broad scope of exemptions for State related processing and provisions for non-consensual processing only adds to the lack of control that people have been given, particularly vis-à-vis the State.

TRAI Recommendations on Privacy

In particular, the Bill was a disappointment in comparison with TRAI's Recommendations on Privacy released just prior to the Bill. This was not without its own problems, for instance, that the scope of the Recommendations, which were to apply to the entire digital ecosystem, encompassed a range of entities far beyond TRAI's jurisdictional boundaries, such as browsers, handsets, tablets, OTT services, applications and the like. However, the recommendations put the individual squarely as the owner of his data. The recommendations thus placed the individual in a much stronger position in relation to his data than under the Bill.

Data Localisation

Yet another consequence of the Data Protection Bill was the suggestion of data localisation of 'critical personal data', an undefined term, in a move that was criticised far and wide for its detrimental effects on innovation. This implies, for instance, that companies can no longer rely on global cloud storage, and that there will be a significant increase in compliance costs.

This is also supported by the RBI's move to mandate data localisation for the data with payment service providers such as card networks and mobile wallets. While the scope of data localisation requirements under the Bill is still unclear, the impact of the RBI's data localisation requirements is already being felt with the launch of payment services like Apple Pay being put on hold. While the aim of retaining the data within India might serve the aim of retaining governmental control of the data, it is unlikely to actually contribute to better security or privacy of the data itself.

The Aadhaar Judgment and its impact

The most significant development for privacy was, of course, the Aadhaar judgment. In a final hearing that spanned 38 days over almost five months, this was the second longest one in Indian history, and the people's involvement, whether for or against Aadhaar, was just as tremendous.

After major arguments against Aadhaar, such as with the privacy implications of the large-scale collection and storage of biometric data, and its potential as a surveillance tool, among others, the Supreme Court finally gave a judgment which supported Aadhaar but largely reduced the wide-scale impact it was having. The major cause for this was the limitation of the use of Aadhaar to Section 7 benefits, as well to governmental use.

Thus, while the biometric database with all of its privacy and security concerns has been retained, the uses it can be put to has been limited, for the present. The limiting of its sharing with private companies has had wide implications, including with bringing an end to its rampant mandatory use, such as for children's school admissions, the NEET, hospital admissions, etc. This has also brought an end to eKYC, in a move that affected not only several digital payment companies but also drone companies. This was followed with debates on whether voluntary use of eKYC was possible, and with the introduction of new, offline methods of verification such as the use of QR codes.

Mandatory linking to bank accounts and SIM cards, which was coupled with the threat to disable those accounts/numbers that were not so linked, was thankfully also brought to an end. However, since the judgment, rumours have already started to surface, of the possibility of the bringing in a new law which mandates the same.

The linking of Aadhaar with Voter IDs was another cause for strife that arose this year, with allegations that non-consensual Aadhaar-EPIC seeding was the primary cause for thousands of voters being missed from Telangana electoral lists this year. Among others, these allegations raise questions on whether the Aadhaar database and access to it are really as private as is claimed.

Others

In addition to these primary concerns, a number of other concerns have emerged, which include, among others, the proposed Social Media Communications Hub which has been challenged before the Supreme Court at present, introduction of the draft DNA bill in Parliament for the creation of a national DNA databank for certain categories of persons, and the proposal of a national AI marketplace for data aggregation.

2019 for Privacy?

Looking at the year gone by for privacy, one can look ahead at 2019 only with concern, since many of these developments discussed here are currently in draft form. 2019 may well see these laws taking concrete form by being enacted. The involvement of the people has played a crucial role in reducing the rampant use of Aadhaar, if not bringing it to a complete halt. While there is a huge movement in the field of privacy and data protection, the people will have to continue playing this role to ensure that it takes the right direction.

The word of caution from UIDAI comes at a time when admissions to nursery and entry-level classes have just begun in over 1,500 private schools in Delhi.

Senior advocate Indira Jaising said the review petition has been filed against the September 26 verdict of the five-judge constitution bench which had said there was nothing in the Aadhaar Act that violated right to privacy of an individual.

The bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra had also upheld the passage of the Aadhaar Bill as a Money Bill by the Lok Sabha.

The review petition has been filed by one Imtiyaz Ali Palsaniya, who had also filed interim applications when the apex court was examining the validity of the Aadhaar scheme.

The petition has also sought an open court hearing in the matter.

In the 56-page petition, the petitioner has said it has been preferred in a ""narrow compass"" seeking to challenge only those aspects of the Aadhaar program as well as the Aadhaar Act, 2016 which were held to be constitutionally valid by the constitution bench.

While declaring the scheme as constitutionally valid, the apex court had struck down some of its provisions including its linking with bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions.

The constitution bench had held that Aadhaar would remain mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN).

""The judgement sought to be reviewed has also not considered a crucial aspect of PAN-Aadhaar linkage, since it fails to satisfy the test laid down by the same court in the very same judgement,"" the review plea said.

It claimed that the Aadhaar program, which had been in existence prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, had itself become an ""instrument of transfer of sensitive personal data"" belonging to citizens to foreign entities acting as biometric service providers at a time when the UIDAI in 2010 had no cyber or technical infrastructure to store such information.

This, the petition claimed, poses a massive national security risk, more so when, according to a Press Information Bureau notification, 100 crore enrolments had already taken place before April 4, 2016.

In its verdict, the apex court had said that Aadhaar would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission.

The bench had also struck down the national security exception under the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016.

Three sets of judgements were pronounced in the matter.

The first one was pronounced by Justice A K Sikri who wrote the judgement for himself, Misra and Justice A M Khanwilkar.

Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice Ashok Bhushan, who were also part of the bench, wrote their individual opinions.

Then, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the world's largest biometric identification database but spelt out its new limitations.

After last year's assertion that Indians have a right to privacy, the apex court in September 2018 redefined the boundaries of the biometric authentication -- Aadhaar can be used for payment of government benefits and taxation records but private companies were barred from accessing it.

In a 4-1 judgement delivered by the Constitution Bench, the Supreme Court held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for the filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN) However, Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporates to use the biometric data was struck down, dealing a body blow to the government's ambitions to make the world's largest biometric project mandatory for a slew of services.

The landmark ruling sent banks, telecom operators and fintech companies -- who relied heavily on Aadhaar eKYC -- scrambling in search of other viable means of customer verification.

As the verdict meant that fulfilling regulatory Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements would have again involved a lot of paperwork for verification purposes, Aadhaar-issuing authority, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), quickly came up with alternate modes like QR (Quick Response) codes, e-Aadhaar and offline methods.

Just as 2018 started to wind down, came another twist in the plot.

Earlier this month, the government decided to propose changes to existing laws - Telegraph Act and PMLA - in order to allow the use of Aadhaar as an ID verification tool for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections, albeit on a voluntary basis.

Additionally, fresh penal provisions have been proposed - through an amendment in Aadhaar Act - to deter companies from insisting on Aadhaar or misusing the biometric data.

The proposed amendments, which will be placed before the Parliament during the ongoing Winter session, propose to arm UIDAI with regulator-like powers to take enforcement actions on the misuse of the national biometric ID and impose stiff penalties on violations.

The compelling reason behind this seems to be the government's belief in the transformative potential of Aadhaar -- the system is so cheap and efficient that it is estimated to have accounted for over 90 per cent of new subscriptions in the telecom sector, according to experts.

More stringent deterrents are likely to be put in place in the coming months.

These might include a penalty for failure to obtain consent for authentication or offline verification -- up to three-year imprisonment or fine of up to Rs 10,000 --, penalty for unauthorised use of core biometric information.

The latter could attract imprisonment between 3-10 years and a fine of up to Rs 10,000.

Even as it dons regulatory role, the UIDAI would continue to accelerate efforts to transform and scale up Aadhaar enrolment and update services, currently available through 30,000 centres operating in designated bank branches, post offices and government premises across the country.

The proposed amendments, which will be placed before the Parliament during the ongoing Winter session, propose to arm UIDAI with regulator-like powers to take enforcement actions on the misuse of the national biometric ID and impose stiff penalties on violations.

The compelling reason behind this seems to be the government's belief in the transformative potential of Aadhaar -- the system is so cheap and efficient that it is estimated to have accounted for over 90 per cent of new subscriptions in the telecom sector, according to experts.

More stringent deterrents are likely to be put in place in the coming months. These might include a penalty for failure to obtain consent for authentication or offline verification -- up to three-year imprisonment or fine of up to Rs 10,000 --, penalty for unauthorised use of core biometric information. The latter could attract imprisonment between 3-10 years and a fine of up to Rs 10,000.

Even as it dons regulatory role, the UIDAI would continue to accelerate efforts to transform and scale up Aadhaar enrolment and update services, currently available through 30,000 centres operating in designated bank branches, post offices and government premises across the country.

'Aadhaar Seva Kendras', similar to the concept of Passport Seva Kendras, will come up in 53 cities across India at an estimated project cost of Rs 300-400 crore. These swanky new centres will be operational by August next year, dishing out appointment-based enrolment, update and other miscellaneous services around Aadhaar, under the watchful eyes of authority's own employees.

Earlier this year, former UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey, recalling his early years as a small-town boy who didn't hold a photo identity for a long time, had reportedly said that Aadhaar offered an answer to an ancient question that was asked by sages -- who am I?

The year that was, ensured that the answer continues to be the 12-digit identifier, at least for those who choose to use it."

Aadhaar, India's extraordinary attempt to give every citizen a biometric identity, is set for a massive revamp with new offline verification tools and non-intrusive ways for people seeking to voluntarily use the 12-digit unique number for new bank accounts and mobile connections.

After twists and turns in 2018, led by the landmark Supreme Court ruling on the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, the UIDAI's efforts around offline modes like eAadhaar and QR code that can leverage the unique ID without any access to biometrics or even revealing the 12-digit number would gather pace in 2019.

From school admissions to getting marriage certificates to paying taxes to taking new mobile connections, Aadhaar touched multiple facets of people's lives as it became the default identifier. This was true for around 1.22 billion Aadhaar holders till doubts emerged that collection of biometric details, even for general service, could infringe on a citizen's privacy rights.

Then, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the world's largest biometric identification database but spelt out its new limitations.

After last year's assertion that Indians have a right to privacy, the apex court in September 2018 redefined the boundaries of the biometric authentication -- Aadhaar can be used for payment of government benefits and taxation records but private companies were barred from accessing it.

In a 4-1 judgement delivered by the Constitution Bench, the Supreme Court held that Aadhaar would remain compulsory for the filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN)

However, Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporates to use the biometric data was struck down, dealing a body blow to the government's ambitions to make the world's largest biometric project mandatory for a slew of services.

The landmark ruling sent banks, telecom operators and fintech companies -- who relied heavily on Aadhaar eKYC -- scrambling in search of other viable means of customer verification.

As the verdict meant that fulfilling regulatory Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements would have again involved a lot of paperwork for verification purposes, Aadhaar-issuing authority, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), quickly came up with alternate modes like QR (Quick Response) codes, e-Aadhaar and offline methods.

With the conclusion of Jammu Municipal Elections after thirteen years came the hope for accountability, solutions for public grievances - hope for a change. Corporators arranged thanks giving lunch/dinner and subsequently visited their wards with respective MLAs, who still had the CDF (Constituency Development Funds) as the assembly was still active and public got much needed confidence booster, once again promises of clean Jammu were given and public started believing the Corporators of their wards. Each and every Corporator's Facebook wall is full of pictures, either of felicitations or of drain cleaning which earlier MLAs were flaunting on social media. Along with all these activities background canvassing for Mayor and Deputy Mayor were also going on.

Despite BJP having clear majority in JMC, election of Mayor seemed to be a tough but ultimately Jammu got its Mayor and Deputy Mayor on 15th November 2018 after many deliberations. With this also the process of photo sessions, felicitation ceremonies commenced and in between Governor dissolved J & K assembly on 21st November and suddenly all MLAs disappeared from scene in shock mode, Mayor and Deputy Mayor became the ultimate VIPs to be invited for inaugurations which they lapped up happily as if posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor were carved out for this purpose only. After nearly one month of their elections first general body meeting of JMC was convened and whatever expectations or dreams public were having got shattered with a bang. If one goes through the agenda of the meeting, 'Seva Bhav' for public disappeared and top priority with unanimity is to increase honorarium of Corporators to at least forty to fifty thousand despite the example laid by PM Modi who had donated 21 lakhs rupee, his personal savings as Chief Minister's salary in 10 years, for educating daughters of drivers and peons working with Gujarat Government. In today's contest it is to think about your interests rest all is secondary.

Eleven items were listed in agenda and it included demand for opening of school for Children of Municipal employees as if there is no government school in entire Jammu , recruitment of Safai Karam Charis - what about the existing ones who work for few hours in the morning and then disappear for their private assignments, promotion orders of employees - for their outstanding efforts to make Jammu a City of garbage and chaos , beautification of JMC walls - as if it is the only place in whole Jammu, no parking zone in JMC premises- to further congest adjoining roads , plantation in and around JMC - to provide better air to corporators, outsourcing of autos for garbage collection, night sanitation and animal birth control programme- to claim no responsibility of theirs in future. Jammuites are shocked and amazed to see no agenda for Jammu public as if all these corporators have been elected for their own cause, for the building of JMC or employees there in. It's not long ago when State High Court had to intervene when a RTI revealed that Rs. 34,65,374 were spent to convert a cattle pond to Municipal Quarter No.10 at Gandhi Nagar which was later allotted to Joint Commissioner (A) who was nearing his superannuation, a gift was given to the former officer at the cost of the rights of the animals.

Similarly a PIL seeking high level probe into the illegal/backdoor allotments of Municipal Quarters/ Flats/ Shops in favour of ex-employees of JMC /private persons and sought investigation by State Vigilance Organization as JMC further extended lease of their accommodations for 40 years at a meager rent of Rs.600 to Rs.900 per month for prime municipal flats situated at Gandhi Nagar, Jammu and beneficiaries included former Commissioner/ Secretary to Government of J&K Housing and Urban Development Department who at one time was JMC Commissioner as well, former Joint Commissioner (Adm) JMC, ex-PA to Commissioner JMC, Driver of JMC, PSO to Commissioner/ Secretary to Govt. of J&K H&UDD to name a few and ultimately the Division Bench ordered for the entire record of more than 600 allotments of JMC assets made in the similar fashion without adopting any procedure/ criteria. Past and present actions are in sync depicting only self use of JMC resources with impunity.

Contrary to JMC, right now SMC (Srinagar Municipal Corporation) is working day and night with Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu leading from front as any feedback on his twitter handle is treated as complaint and corrective measures are taken immediately. Srinagar public is actively participating and enjoying the proactive approach of their Mayor. No day has gone since taking oath when Mayor and Deputy Mayor have not visited different problematic areas and on spot decisions have been taken. All reharis have been asked to register so that some alternative arrangements are made to accommodate them in a phased manner but in Jammu Mayor has ordered restoration of illegal Kiosks in front of GMC to be restored at unused matador stand despite traffic bottle neck in the area. Another worth mention decision by SMC is collection of waste from butcheries so that the it is properly dumped at the authorized site but no such initiative at Jammu. Sunday bazaar market of Lal Chowk has been regularized with nominal fee, all encroachments are getting removed in a phased manner including bunkers , traffic police kiosks on footpath, suggestions / plans are being made for beautification, requisition for funds for water bodies preservation are few other measures. Though identical is the situation at Jammu's Sunday market right from Bus stand, Shalamar, City Chowk, Super bazaar, Purani Mandi, Raj Tilak road to Parade but no such stream lining or revenue generation initiative. SMC Mayor is regularly arranging meetings of different departments for better co-ordination for quick and better results but it requires a herculean effort to get one's street light repaired at Jammu. All talks little action is the buzz word at Jammu.

Coming back to JMC, only way to lodge complaint is through their web site and believe it requires hell lot of effort to get registered your complaint and the mobile number of contact person you receive by return SMS is either non -existent or the concerned person is not responsible for the concerned ward. Countless Commissioners have been replaced in a span of last three years without any result so much so that Smart City project is standing at same place from where it started but who bothers. There is no Solid Waste Disposal site/policy in place despite number of reminders from High Court, no STP in place as such whole sewage waste is being dumped in river Tawi from where drinking water is supplied to whole old city, no fogging during monsoon to check dengue. Plastic carry bags are sold openly in the market, from where they are procured and how they reach market is not priority of JMC reasons better known to them only. No scheme in place for door to door household garbage collection and no campaign in media for public awareness. There is no transparency in dog sterilization program as these services are shuttling between NGOs and Municipality and both blaming each other for the failure to curtail dog menace in almost every ward. No biometric attendance of employees in place with the result even newly elected corporators are running pillar to post to get allocated nonexistent Safai workers of their respective wards. Leaking water pipes of drinking water in drains are there in every ward as there is no mechanism in place for coordination between JMC and PHE, civil wing of JMC unable to get repaired the damaged lanes as there is no accountability, illegal infrastructures coming up despite army of 17 exclusive employees in Enforcement wing of JMC to look after 75 wards. High Court has to intervene time and again to rap JMC for repeated deficiency of services but that too is of little use and all these glaring lapses are testimony to failure of parental department which was with BJP for last 3 years.

Earlier MLAs were performing the duties of Corporators, looking after lanes, drains of the area but their half hearted efforts were more intended for photo sessions as such it had yielded only shoddy work which disappeared with the first monsoon shower of the season as there is no check on quality of work as no supervising engineer is there on site to see whether drains have proper slope or lanes have been laid as per set parameters or the resultant malba lifted. There is urgent need of streamlining the system with latest techniques along with innovative ideas to get the things done in proper manner. Installing vending machines for plastic bottles at all public places, converting flowers collected from temples to incense sticks, rain water harvesting in new buildings are few innovations which all modern cities are adopting. Mayor or concerned staff of JMC should visit Indore, the cleanest city of India, for practical ideas how they achieved this as with the elections approaching fast and BJP running the JMC now it's their last chance to set things right which their ministers and MLAs had failed in the past and with their own Government at Centre and President's rule in state they don't have any excuse this time right now. One hopes JMC takes corrective measures to put a system in place instead of random knee jerk measures which are of no use. Planning and implementation are the most important aspects without which JMC is bound to fail once again this time as well as in the past. Right now the question of public is, will they deliver this time?

As reported by Telangana Today, the department tied up with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS) for implementing the Aadhaar biometric attendance. The attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff will be recorded twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal, so that the attendance recorded on the biometric machines could be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal."

Following the Supreme Court's decision in Murphy v. NCAA, which overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Regulation Act and cleared the way for more widespread legalized gambling, the regulation of how wearables may be used has gained attention. Analysis of these developments is complicated by the evolving legal landscape surrounding wearable tech, the privacy implications and the various types of biometric data it may collect.

Wearable technology is a blanket term for a type of electronic monitor that can be worn on the body, typically either sewn into clothing or otherwise incorporated in an accessory and often wirelessly connected to the internet to transmit data collected through sensors in the device. Wearables can track a wide variety of information about the wearer, such as heart rate, glucose levels, pulse oximetry, sleep patterns, gait, and other physical and physiological metrics that can facilitate the assessment of performance and recovery in sports. These physical and physiological data points may be considered ""biometric information"" under the definitions of that term that appear in certain laws. Within the broader category of biometric information is a subset of data referred to as ""biometric identifiers,"" which are unique biological characteristics that can be used to identify a person. Examples of biometric information are more general data points such as height and weight, whereas a fingerprint is considered a biometric identifier because it is unique to an individual. For athletes and coaches, wearables can provide meaningful insights about athletic performance, stress, rest and recovery, and their use has grown exponentially in recent years.

Currently, Major League Baseball (MLB) is the only American professional sports league that permits wearables to be used in games, thereby allowing for analysis of the causes of various ailments common among baseball players, such as specific stresses on pitchers. For example, a common injury suffered by pitchers, an ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) tear, can sideline a player for well over a year. In 2016, MLB and the MLB Players Association approved the in-game use of a sensor-laden sleeve designed to specifically measure the stress on a pitcher's arm throughout a game. In addition to measuring pitch count, the sleeve measures arm speed, rotation and force on the elbow with every throw, possibly allowing pitchers to avoid injury through rest and pitch correction. While the sleeve is pitcher-specific, MLB players in any position may utilize other types of wearables; for example, players may use wrist sensors that measure heart rate and body strain over a day, heart rate and breathing monitors, or GPS trackers. Although use of these devices is allowed during games and practice, a player's use is strictly voluntary and can be terminated by the player at any time. In fact, the most recent MLB Collective Bargaining Agreement (the MLB CBA) states that a team must destroy the information collected by wearables if requested by a player.

Similar to the MLB CBA, the National Basketball Association's 2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement (the NBA CBA) sets certain standards to combat the potential manipulation of wearables, codified in Article XXII Section 13. Use is prohibited during games, and use in practice is strictly voluntary. The NBA CBA specifies that ""data collected from a Wearable worn at the request of a team may be used for player health and performance purposes and Team on-court tactical and strategic purposes only."" To honor this stipulation, any team requesting a player use wearable technology must explain in writing precisely what's being tracked, how the team will be using this data and the benefits to the player of obtaining and analyzing the data. In addition to the player, this written explanation goes to the Wearables Committee, a six-person panel composed of three representatives from the players' union and three from the NBA itself. Per the NBA CBA, the Wearables Committee is also charged with reviewing and approving wearable devices as well as setting the proper cybersecurity standards for the retention of biometrics. The MLB CBA implemented a similar panel, the Joint Committee on Wearable Technology, composed of members from the MLB Players Association and MLB.

The NBA CBA outlines the specific consequences for misuse of players' biometric data. If the player agrees to use the wearable, the NBA CBA explicitly prohibits the use of this collected biometric data in contract and salary negotiations. Any team found in violation of the prohibition faces a $250,000 fine. Despite this potential threat, NBA players may still find themselves wary of the misuse of biometric information. By the terms of both the NBA CBA and the MLB CBA, players are allowed to cease use of wearables at any time for any reason. With technology still developing rapidly, these agreements set important standards concerning the ownership of this potentially sensitive data and attempts to balance both teams' and players' desires for excellence with appropriate privacy protection.

While the NBA, NHL and NFL all prohibit in-game use of wearables, the NFL Players Association offered its athletes the opportunity to monetize their own athletic performance data. In 2017, the NFL Players Association announced a five-year partnership with a wearables company with the hope of accurately tracking recovery in between games and workouts. The deal explicitly lays out that the players themselves control the data and have rights to sell it to third parties if they so choose. In this scenario, ethical considerations relevant to monetizing private data are in the hands of each player rather than those of the teams or leagues.

In the college context, without a players' union to advocate for specific standards concerning wearable use, ad hoc wearable use is regulated by school and NCAA rules. The NCAA does allow the use of wearables in games; however, it prohibits real-time data analysis during games to the extent such analysis is used to make performance-enhancing adjustments. As wearables become more sophisticated and their use is increasingly ubiquitous, it is likely that guidelines of this nature will evolve.

Currently in the United States, three states - Illinois, Texas and Washington - have implemented laws that regulate the collection and retention of biometric identifiers. Given technological developments that have occurred since the Illinois and Texas laws were passed (in 2008 and 2009, respectively), it is perhaps understandable that the definition of biometric identifiers in those laws is limited to retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, and hand or face geometry. As a result, in their current form, those laws do not apply to many types of data captured by a wearable tracker. However, the newer Washington law includes ""other unique biological patterns or characteristics"" in its definition of biometric identifier, which could be interpreted to cover the type of data collected by many wearables. Additionally, the newly passed California Consumer Privacy Act includes exercise or health data in its definition of biometric information, which means data collected by wearables is likely to be subject to a host of new regulations beginning in June 2020.

Beyond laws governing the collection and retention of biometric data, several state data security breach laws, including the Colorado, Maryland, North Carolina and Wisconsin statutes, have added ""biometric data"" to their definitions of personal information that, if compromised, may trigger an obligation to provide notification to regulators and affected individuals. As the use of biometric identifiers in everyday life becomes more and more common and value of data collected by wearable technology continues to increase, it is likely that wearable technology companies and their rich stores of personal information will be appealing targets for hackers.

Given the exponential growth of wearable technology, as well as skyrocketing reliance on biometric identifiers, it seems inevitable that additional legislation will be proposed, perhaps including laws that would govern the manufacture and use of objects and clothing that harvest biometric data as well as the ways in which that data may be used and shared.

Players should educate themselves on their rights and the potential privacy implications if they choose to collect, share and/or allow third parties to have access to their data derived from wearables. Despite not being specifically covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), best practices would demand similar confidential treatment for all who have access to such data. Leagues, teams, players, developers and other interested parties should closely follow legal developments and be vigilant in their data protection efforts to ensure they remain in compliance with the various agencies and governments regulating the various aspects of wearable technology."

About 25,000 schools -- including primary, upper primary and high schools -- will get the biometric equipment. Already, the Aadhaar biometric attendance system was being used in 9,349 government-run schools in 12 districts across Telangana. Now, the Directorate of School Education decided to extend the system to all government-run schools and sent a proposal to the State government seeking budgetary support for installing the machines.

The department tied up with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS) for implementing the Aadhaar biometric attendance. One biometric machine was being provided for every 100 students, with managements being directed to record attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal.

""The attendance recorded on the biometric machines will be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal. As it is linked with Aadhaar, the managements cannot duplicate admissions,"" an official said.

The machines and software were designed in such a way that biometric fingerprints captured are immediately verified with the biometric details available with UIDAI using Internet and is reflected in the dashboard of the School Education Department's website. A software was being developed to transmit the captured details offline or when network is available in the schools located in remote areas.

""Most students and teachers in schools where the machines are already in use are giving their attendance on it. The department sent a proposal to the government seeking budget for implementing the system in all schools from the next academic year,"" an official said, adding that there were some network issues in certain schools located in remote areas with these being sorted out."

Forced as a ""Money Bill"", which can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha (Rajya Sabha cannot make amendments to such bills), Aadhaar Bill, 2016 passed the Parliament amidst heated debates. Opposition members had raised concerns on the privacy of individuals following enactment of the law.

What is all this fuss about Aadhaar, anyway? It's just a twelve digit number, you may say. But with that same number, the government (and probably, some foreign entities) can know about your personal details such as mobile number, date of birth, residential address, the amount of money in your savings accounts, the loans you have availed, PAN, the income tax you pay, stocks you own, provident fund details, the land you own, the vehicle you drive, your life insurance policies, and on and on and on.

Based on this data, the government (or a foreign organisation) can get a pretty detailed picture of who you are. It can profile you by the places you travel, the food you eat, the movies you watch, your political views, and through many other instances. Based on this, the state can practically map out your thoughts. Add Artificial Intelligence into it, and voila, the government can, with reasonable accuracy, ""predict"" what you do next! Sounds like Big Brother on steroids? In a few years, we may well find ourselves in such a scenario.

Are there any analogues of this kind anywhere in the world? Not by a long shot. In the US, all citizens and immigrants on a work visa have a Social Security Number (SSN), a nine-digit unique identity linked to your name, without biometric data. And SSN is not mandatory for availing many services, the way it is being done in India right now.

Though the recent Supreme Court judgment on Aadhaar in September has made it ""not mandatory"" for linking Aadhaar with services such as mobile numbers, bank accounts, school admissions and entrance exams, many operators and authorities are still insisting on Aadhaar.

A writ petition has been filed in the Supreme Court by renowned rights activist Dr Kalyani Menon Sen on the grave privacy implications of Aadhaar. She shares, ""One of UIDAI's certified contractors is US-based L-1 Identity Solutions, whose officers have served in the Intelligence agencies of US. An Indian citizen's data can be transmitted to a foreign government, compromising India's sovereignty, national security and severely undermining the privacy and autonomy of individuals.""

Recently, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Chairman RS Sharma threw a challenge and tweeted his Aadhaar number, asking if it had made him vulnerable. A French security expert who goes by the Twitter handle @fs0c131y was able to get his address, date of birth and alternate phone number, before tweeting back to Sharma and cautioning him.

A paper 'Biometrics and its impact in India' released by Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), an arm of RBI, points out, ""Thanks to Aadhaar, for the first time in the history of India, there is now a readily available single target for cyber criminals as well as India's external enemies. In a few years, attacking UIDAI data can potentially cripple Indian businesses and administration in ways that were inconceivable a few years ago. The loss to the economy and citizens in case of such an attack is bound to be incalculable.""

The project was initially conceived for Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, and then slowly morphed itself to become 'mandatory' in every aspect of our lives. Is Aadhaar doing a good job in DBT? As per reports across various publications, on the contrary, it has been the cause of various starvation-related deaths due to lack of ration provided to the poor (ostensibly due to lack of Aadhaar, failure in biometric authentication, and a host of other reasons).

As per news reports, bank officials are given targets to link 15 to 20 accounts with Aadhaar every day. Their incentives and promotions are linked to such targets.And after more than 90 percent Indians have enrolled for Aadhaar and have given it away to numerous service providers, UIDAI has launched its Aadhaar virtual ID scheme, which many experts say is just hogwash. The virtual ID enables you to generate a random 16-digit number mapped to your Aadhaar number which can be used with service providers.

Jean Dreze, a former member of UPA's National Advisory Council, quoted, ""The first lie was that Aadhaar is a voluntary facility. Today, we know that this was just doublespeak. Soon it will be virtually impossible to live in India without Aadhaar."" And Shyam Divan, a senior advocate practising in the Supreme Court, quoted Aadhaar project as an ""electronic leash"" to keep people under control.

The time may soon come when Aadhaar is asked for booking domestic and international flight tickets, rail tickets, booking movies online, at apparel stores, hypermarkets, etc., all in the name of providing ""speedy services"" and for improving ""customer experience and convenience"".

The stress may have long-lasting health effects, reveals a study of a diverse group of more than 2,400 low-income women.

The study in American Journal of Perinatology involved women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds who were interviewed and evaluated at five different clinical sites in the United States.

In addition to insight into health risks facing new mothers, researchers united by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Community Child Health Network found evidence that women who breastfeed their babies may receive some protection from the health damage caused by physical stress of pregnancy and giving birth.

""All mothers are affected by stress, but low-income women and especially African-American and Hispanic women have more adverse health-risk profiles during their children's first years of life,"" said Sharon Landesman Ramey, a professor and distinguished research scholar at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC and an author of the paper. ""Our study was designed to look for biomarkers that are sensitive to psychological and physical stressors, and in turn determine whether those stressors contribute to poor outcomes for mothers and children.""

Working groups of clinicians guided by scientists and community members recorded blood pressures, heart rates, cholesterol profiles, body mass indexes, waist-hip ratios, and other biomarkers in women six months and one year after they had given birth. In addition, women were assessed before they gave birth, some even before they became pregnant.

The readings were used to create a composite measurement of ""allostatic load,"" which represents the cumulative physical and psychological strain on their bodies after delivery. The study may be the first to examine a large group of women at intervals over the course of a year using demographic, biometric, and biomarker measures.

Readings were taken to look at the post-delivery effects of pregnancy on mothers' cardiometabolic risks in partnership with groups at five clinical sites in the U.S., including medical centers in Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and North Carolina.

More than one half of the women in the study were classified as overweight or obese prior to becoming pregnant.

""We thoroughly looked at the effects of stress alongside levels of poverty and minority status to understand poor health outcomes for moms and children,"" said Madeleine Shalowitz, a Research Professor of Pediatrics at the Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of Chicago, Program Director of Outcomes Research at NorthShore University HealthSystem Research Institute, and a co-investigator in the study. ""Filling this knowledge gap could lead to health interventions to lower the risk of chronic disease for mothers, many of whom are planning to have more children. As many of these women will become pregnant again, improving their health will lead to a healthier next pregnancy.""

During pregnancy, dramatic changes occur in a woman's immune and cardiovascular systems to support the developing fetus.

In healthy women, maternal physiology gradually returns to normal within a year after delivery, but a persistently elevated allostatic load increases a woman's risk for chronic diseases across a lifetime.

The researchers said the results of the study are important for improving health and also to address interventions for disadvantaged groups.

As for why breastfeeding was shown to provide some health benefits 12 months postpartum, the study said it could be a cumulative effect reflecting longer durations of breastfeeding compounded by a better socioeconomic status for women who can afford to breastfeed for longer periods.

A large research network in the National Institutes of Health united with community members to execute the research.

""This study was extraordinary because it included community members as full partners at all of the clinical sites, working alongside health-care providers and scientists to determine how stress is affecting mothers and the next generation of babies,"" Landesman Ramey said. ""The hope is that when people realize health-care providers, citizen activists, and neighbors approved the work and contributed to it, they will have more confidence in the information and it will be shared in a good way, to improve health outcomes.""

The patients became involved through programs medical centers representing diverse populations at three urban sites including Washington, D.C.; Baltimore, Maryland; and Los Angeles County, California; one suburban site at Lake County, Illinois; and one rural site comprising seven counties in eastern North Carolina.
